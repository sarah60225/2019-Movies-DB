Anyone who has seen either of Daniel Craig’s previous portrayals of the secret agent already know this. Craig’s Bond is more visceral, action oriented and serious than any of the previous versions of the famed super spy. This is not a bad thing though, as each new actor is supposed to bring something new to the franchise, and Daniel Craig has delivered. What’s great about Skyfall, the newest entry in the 007 franchise, is that the movie itself finally embraces this idea. Skyfall knows it’s not your typical James Bond movie, and it runs with it to great effect.\r\n\r\nIn the pre-Craig Bond era, many of the movies fizzled because they tried too hard to recreate what everyone thought James Bond should be. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace completely obliterated this notion by introducing Daniel Craig as the new James Bond, and rebuilding the character from the ground up.  \r\n\r\nWhile the movies turned out great, many fans were upset that the film was missing a lot of what made a James Bond movie a James Bond movie. In Skyfall, this gripe gets alleviated as the old and new James Bond fuse together to create the perfect mix of old-school homage and new generation ass kicking. \r\n\r\nLongtime fans of the franchise will find themselves grinning from ear to ear throughout the movie as various references to older Bond movies pop up left and right. However, these aren’t your typical “in joke” references typically scattered throughout Bond movies, this time they actually serve a purpose in the overall plot of the movie, and they manage to make these references to the past new again by flipping expectations on their head. The result is longtime fans finally getting what they wanted from Craig’s Bond, but in a way they never would have expected.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, what separates an average 007 film from a great one is the presence of an iconic villain, and Javier Bardem’s performance as the villainous Silva is what really pushes Skyfall over the top. He only appears midway through the film, in what is surely one of the best character introductions I have seen, and definitely the best scene in the movie. From that point on he really steals every scene that he is in. He’s menacing, memorable, intelligent, a little psychotic, and most importantly of all, has a very tangible motive for his actions. All of these things combine together to create one of the best Bond villains to date.\r\n\r\nOne rather peculiar aspect of this Bond movie is that it doesn’t focus wholly on James Bond. For the first time M, Bond’s Superior, once again played beautifully by Judi Dench, gets more than just a supporting role. In fact, she has nearly as much screen time as Bond himself. This might sound silly, but in the context of the plot, which mainly revolves around M and her relationship to Silva, it works.\r\n\r\nIt’s quite rare that a two and a half hour movie stays engaging throughout, but Skyfall was so entertaining that it seemed to zoom by in what seemed like five minutes. The incredibly intense opening sequence puts a vice grip on your attention span and never let’s go. The movie is packed with some of the best action sequences since the Bourne series, and quite a few really amazing set pieces that are sure to make your jaw drop. Not to mention the acting is spot on and the plot has you on edge the whole time. The whole product is really quite a marvel of entertainment.\r\n\r\nI did have a few gripes though. There are a few characters that are just kind of there throughout the movie. They play enough of a role to the point where they can’t be considered background characters, but they don’t really do anything more than just exist. It’s a minor issue, but it was kind of strange. Also, by far the coolest set piece in the whole movie, an entire deserted island city, only get’s a few minutes of screen time. I would have loved to get to see more of it because it seems so interesting, but instead we are treated to a brisk walk down one of the streets. Overall though, these complaints are very minor, and they shouldn’t stop anyone from seeing one of the best James Bond movies ever put to film.','Midway',12,3,'2012-11-11 01:19:37'),('13a917','The Studio Ghibli Collection - Minneapolis Lagoon Cinema, Nov 16-29.

What am I missing with this film? (INEVITABLE SPOILERS)','Hi r/movies,\r\n\r\nI recently saw Django Unchained and I can say I\'m very confused at why this movie is so heavily hyped, loved and considered a great movie. The movie came off to me as very disjointed. The first hour of the movie was incredibly different then the last to the point that I felt like I was watching two very distinct movies. The first half (which I obviously liked) was very reminiscent of the humor/comedic take on WWII that Inglorious Bastards achieved. In honesty, that first half seemed like a re-skin of Inglorious Bastards. \r\n\r\nNow, after the midpoint when they kill the Brittle Brothers and attempt on the journey of saving his wife the movie takes a very sharp turn. While comedic moments still occur we are really made uncomfortable with scenes like the wrestling, or the man beating eaten alive by dogs. I understand Quentin Taratino\'s thing is to make his audience feel uncomfortable, but this seemed almost tasteless. We already know from the beginning that this movie deals with slavery, inequality, etc, and most of these scenes did nothing but to reaffirm again what we had already been told with added shock value. Furthermore, the continued use of scenes like this or Django nearly losing his privates at the end just further dragged the movie on while adding nothing new. \r\n\r\nLooking back it does seem that I harped badly about this film, but honestly I really enjoyed the first hour to hour and a half. I\'m just bummed that the movie seemed to drag on for a very long time for the inevitable (nearly everyone dies, but the good guy and his heroine end). I also, have to say that the cinematography wasn\'t anything stellar and I\'d much rather watch Taratino\'s earlier works (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) again since they seemed to add something new to the table.\r\n\r\nI want to rewatch this movie again but I want some help on what I should be looking for so I can admire this movie as much as the rest of /r/movies, critics and my peers seem to be.

Both movies involve physical violence, but Rises jumps wildly from one to the other (fists, guns, knives, bombs, tanks, all interchanging in rapid succession).

','Last night I had the immense displeasure of viewing Paranormal Activity 4. Before I delve into the load of horse shit that this movie was, let me give you some background info.\r\n\r\nIn the first Paranormal Activity a couple, Micah and Katie begin filming themselves because they think there\'s a ghost in their house. After about an hour of doors being opened by the ghost, it finally decides to cut the shit and possesses Katie, who then kills Micah by Falcon Punching him into the camera. \r\n\r\nIn the second movie, a prequel to the first, Katie\'s sister, Kristi and husband Dan seem to have a ghost haunting their house. Dan\'s sluething daughter figures out that the ghost must be after Kristi\'s son, Hunter, the first son born into Katie and Kristi\'s family since the 1930s. The ghost pulls its usually tomfoolery before ghost-biting Kristi on the leg and possessing her. OH, Katie also had bite marks, so I guess it possesses people by biting them or something. Dan passes the ghost from Kristi to Katie because he\'s a shitty brother-in-law and katie repays the favor by snapping his neck three weeks later (the night after PA1). Another Falcon Punch disposes of Kristi, and Katie snatches away Hunter, taking him to god knows where. \r\n\r\nParanormal Activity 3 is yet another prequel, this time answering what the girl\'s, Katie and Kristi, childhood must have been like. They live with their mom and her boyfriend in 1988 california. Kristi has an invisible friend, doors open, cameras, yada yada yada, same old shit. The boyfriend, Dennis, figures out through some careful sluething that the ghost is actually a demon and that witches used to brainwash girls into having sons that they\'d give up to the demon. Mom and BF get scared and move the girls to their Grandma\'s house. The grandma, Lois, is actually a witch and after a game of hide and seek and some brutal back breaking, Mom and BF Dennis are dead. The girls are then led upstairs to a room by the witches where they are presumed to be raped by the ghost and then forget that the ghost raped them and gave them a son. Or something. \r\nOh the ghost is named Toby, the least frightening name of all time. \r\n\r\nOn to the last movie. Though the other 3 movies were admittedly pretty awful, they don\'t even compare to the diaper full of baby diarrhea that is Paranormal Activity 4. It starts off with a family who have a young girl named alex and a son named Wyatt. The girl, who is clearly like 15, is dating some dude that looks like he is 20 something. Across the street lives a young boy named Robbie, who spends the entire movie livin it up it his fat-guy sweats and sandals with socks. He\'s mildly creepy, but honestly it just seems like he\'s autistic or has some sort of social disorder. Suspicious of the young boy, Alex and BF decide to spy on the whole house using webcam chats. Actually, using SKYPE. They then realize that at night they can view the living room by using the XBOX KINNECT. Alex makes fun of her BF, teasing him for doing too much on his IPHONE. at this point, the prominant product placement gets to be a bit much, and we\'re only like 20 minutes into the movie. There are like 3 or 4 five-minute scenes where the Kinnect is key. A third of the film is a commercial for the Xbox! Robbie then introduces Wyatt to his invisible friend and draws symbols on him to make the ghost appear to him. It\'s revealed that Robbie\'s mom is actually Katie. From the first 3 films. Then she tells Wyatt that he\'s adopted (turns out she\'s right) and that his name is Hunter. He gets possessed, there\'s more neck breaking and the film ends with Alex being attacked by like 50 zombie people. The film makes ZERO sense.\r\n\r\nKatie took Hunter at the end of the 2nd film. Where did she get Robbie and why did she give Hunter back to an adoption agency if she was just going to go steal him away again? These are questions that will be answered in the forthcoming Paranormal Activity 5, 6, and 7, I\'m sure, but it does little to disguise this movie from what it really is, a money grab. The plot makes no sense and a majority of the film is spent plugging companies. Even Prius gets a word in there somehow.\r\n\r\nI hope this is the last movie of this kind, as it made a fuck ton of money and took literally no thought or effort to make. Seriously. No sense.\r\n\r\nToby is about as good of a demon as Toby Flenderson is a good HR Rep.

Of course, that was a long time ago and the Australian national demeanor has since shifted from “kill or be killed” to “live and let live,” but David Michôd’s gritty 2010 drama Animal Kingdom chronicled some of the country’s more modern criminal descendents. In his upcoming sophomore effort, The Rover, the director takes things even further.*\r\n\r\n*Robert Pattinson plays a denizen of the Outback in the near future, after a worldwide financial collapse has sent many like him running to the still viable mines of the Australian desert. “It’s like a new gold rush,” says Michôd. “Where people from all corners of the world have come out to the desert to scrape out an existence. Petty criminals and miscreants and hustlers.” Guy Pearce, who had an uncharacteristically reserved role in Animal Kingdom, gets to sink his teeth into a nicely nasty part opposite Pattinson. “The basic story is really quite elemental,” says Michôd. “You’ve got a really dark, dangerous, murderous person in Guy’s character, and in Rob’s character you have a quite troubled and damaged, but beautiful and naïve, soul.”*\r\n\r\n*Of course, just by its setting and basic plot, The Rover is poised to draw comparisons to one of the antipodean country’s most memorable cinematic contributions. “You put cars in the desert in Australia and people are going to think of Mad Max,” says Michôd. “And with all due respect to that film — and I stress that — I think The Rover is going to be way more chillingly authentic and menacing.”*\r\n\r\nText is from [EW](http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/03/13/robert-pattinson-guy-pearce-the-rover-first-look/).','Hustlers',1,0,'2013-03-13 10:12:51'),('1adwcz','LEAKED!- The opening text crawl to J.J Abrams\' Star Wars Episode VII ','','Crawl',0,2,'2013-03-15 21:21:03'),('1af3vg','Need help with a movie title.','Need help figuring out a movie title.

I read it a few months ago. Here\'s the plot (FULL OF SPOILERS):  It\'s the near future. An AI researcher is assassinated by a group of anti-AI terrorists but before he dies, his brilliant scientist wife transfers her husband\'s consciousness into a super-computer. A Friend of the wife\'s, a scientist who is more wary of AI development, counsels against it but he can\'t stop the wife from doing so — this has never been attempted, no one is quite sure what this will result in. The husband\'s consciousness metamorphoses into a machine intelligence — something less than human, more pure AI — and establishes a huge base of operations in the desert, ostensibly to protect itself against the anti-AI terrorists as well as government intervention. But it\'s really putting into place a plan for world domination as it now sees itself as some kind of benevolent overlord. The wife is essentially in a state of denial (and is herself a victim of emotional manipulation on the part of the AI) and keeps helping her \'husband\' even as it uses lethal measures to protect itself and extend its sphere of control. This involves manufacturing nano-tech that allows the AI to rewrite humans (creating super-soldiers) and do all sorts of nasty stuff. Meanwhile, the Scientist friend of the wife (who cares about her but can\'t convince her that she\'s aiding the inhuman AI) struggles against the AI\'s machinations by helping the anti-AI terrorists. Mankind is essentially brought back to 19th century-level technology when the only \'cure\' for the AI\'s manipulation worldwide of computer systems is to destroy all networked computer systems everywhere. Civilization, essentially, goes through an apocalypse in its war against the AI. There\'s a twist at the end that reveals the AI isn\'t truly destroyed and exists in the nanotech which has now integrated itself into the fabric of our world.

Ask me anything. Anything at all. \r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the sorts of films I make the tend to premiere at an A-list festival (Toronto International Film Festival or somewhere like that) have boutique theatrical releases and then go out on broadcasters like HBO in the US, Channel 4 in the UK, VPRO in The Netherlands, WDR in Germany, ABC in Australia - all over the place basically. \r\n\r\nMy latest film The Dark Matter of Love tells the story of three Russian children Masha (11) and Marcel and Vadim (twin five year old boys who bring the ruckus in a major way) learning to love their adoptive American family through a scientific programme. \r\n\r\nAs the Diaz family fall in love the children blossom in the most incredible way - they make friends at school and become more open and affectionate with their new family. Close relationships can be difficult for children who have grown up in institutions. But with courage, humour and bravery these three children allow themselves to experience the love of a family for the very first time.\r\n\r\nOn January the 1st 2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin passed a law banning the adoption of Russian children into American families.\r\n\r\nApproximately 300 Russian children have met and started to fall in love with their families but can no longer complete their adoptions because of the new law.\r\n\r\nWhile I was making the film I had no idea that President Putin was going to pass this law. Suddenly my film is a 90 minute demonstration of what these children are being denied.\r\n\r\nI spent two years making the film and I witnessed the effect a families’ love can have on a child’s development. I fell very much in love with the whole Diaz family and Masha and I share a really special bond. There was this incredible moment when my crew and I were driving away from the orphanage and Masha ran alongside our van and put her hand on my hand through the glass. \r\n\r\nThis little girl who didn’t need anyone was reaching out to me and I’ve never felt anything like it. I was sitting there looking at my camera man just welling up. And that was the start of a really extraordinary friendship. \r\n\r\nAfter the Diaz\'s met the children they were delayed picking them up because there were some issues with their paperwork and Masha’s orphanage carer told me that Masha had been asking about her new family everyday. Are they still coming to pick me up? Do they still want me?\r\n\r\nThe thought that approximately 300 children just like Masha are stuck in that situation right now breaks my heart. All they’ve ever wanted is a family. That dream comes alive when they meet their new Mum and Dad. And that dream dies when they are caught up in a political situation that has nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nSo I\'m using my film to raise awareness of the situation facing these 300 children to a level that puts pressure on the US and Russian governments to put politics aside and find a way to get these children into loving families. \r\n\r\nHow can the film help - I hear you ask? Well, I\'m glad you did:\r\n\r\nWe screened on Capitol Hill in Washington DC in April and are premiering at Moscow International Film Festival in June. Parents fighting to bring their children home will come face to face with the officials responsible for the ban at our screening. \r\n\r\nThrough a screening tour of Russia and the US we intend to raise the profile of the situation, harness international dissent across social media platforms and put pressure on both the American and Russian governments to find a way to get these children into loving families.\r\n\r\nWe\'re about to launch a Kickstarter campaign - preview link is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/darkmatterlove/269964877?token=3e35980b\r\n\r\nThe campaign goes live in June (when I\'m hoping this AMA will be up). \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my AMA, really do seriously Ask Me Anything.\r\n','Fighting with My Family',4,3,'2013-05-22 09:20:06'),('1eu17x','New full length trailer for The World\'s End\"\"\"\"','','Crawl',2412,876,'2013-05-22 10:01:11'),('1f942n','Most three-dimensional characters?','Who is a character who is evil, but also is good?

I remember watching one film on the last night of his life: Apollo 13. This is me trying to figure it out what it all meant.','I write this in anticipation of the tenth anniversary of my father’s untimely death from a brain tumour at the age of 42, back in July 2003. I am also using tribute as an indulgent opportunity to try and foist my interest of film in relation to the last night of his life at the Arthur Rank Hospice in Cambridge. I apologise in advance. This could turn out to be a frankly banal and hedonistic attempt to create a transcendent relation between film and the death of an individual, who should be beyond the exploitation of someone like me. Heck, I’ve exploited him enough to get me through countless creative writing exercises back in school. I would wish my children to do the same if I meet a similar fate as my father’s. So, Death don’t fail me now! Let’s begin.\r\n\r\nMy dad worked for Cisco Systems and had to make the daily 100 mile trip up to London to get to the place. He got up with a pounding headache and left the house in his company car BMW. Just as he was about to hit the M11 motorway, his head began to get heavier to the point where he did something I rarely heard him do. That is, turn around. From my vague memory, he was diagnosed on the May Day of 2002: glioblastoma, the size of a tangerine. For the life of me, I cannot remember the news that he was going to die or that the tumour was terminal. It was a gradual breaking of news. Implicit, perhaps, but it was a slow and less painful road to death. During this time, it was hard to ignore the characteristic face bloating after steroid treatment and the hair loss from chemotherapy. More so, his mind steadily began to dissolve after Christmas. I seemed to remember one night in which he came into my room. I was weeping over his transformation and the inevitable loss which will take hold. His paunchy body sat on my bed, after which I blubbered “Dad…this is shit.”. He replied in a half-broken voice, “Yes. It is shit”. That was it, right there. I have never heard my dad swear all my life, but this hit me as the low point. My dad could not conceal or compose himself, as the dutiful male is expected to do. As the days wore on, so did his regression. After a spate of collapses, he was admitted to the Arthur Rank in June. From then onwards, coherent speech was lost and his conscience dimmed.\r\n\r\nIn mid-July, the school year was nearing its end at Soham Village College. As it was a last week custom, us pupils had to watch Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone for the umpteenth time (the film was in French). A third of the way through, I got pulled out of class and met my mum at the reception: “We’re at the last stage”. With my two brothers and sister picked up from their schools, we made our way to the hospice where we were told our dad had entered into a coma. When we got there the staff moved him in his bed from his room to the play/recreation area where he was parked up near the entrance. At the other end of the room there was a television with the obligatory VHS copies of various 90s kiddie fare, a number of sleeping bags and a futon which could be pulled out from a slightly decaying sofa. The light coming from the sliding door windows - spanning two sides - covered the rest of the room. \r\n\r\nBy the afternoon, I thought about a two things. First of all: I’m sure in this grave situation I can get away by asking my mum if we could have a McDonalds. Secondly, I was contemplating what the chaplain read a moment ago. Being a characteristic passage of priming for the hardships of death, he quoted The Pilgrim’s Progress: \r\n\r\n“When the day that he must go hence was come, many accompanied him to the river-side, into which as he went, he said, “Death, where is thy sting?” And as he went down deeper, he said, “Grave, where is thy victory?” So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side”\r\n\r\nIt’s a grand couple of sentences reflecting on the comfort of religious symbolism. If Dad can get his trumpets when he passes over, I guess I should be happy. However, I cannot get over the extravagance of such a leap of faith. The passage leaves me with more doubt than it does reassurance. \r\n\r\nThe purple hue of evening soon subdued to dark. After McDonalds, we returned to a more solitary hospice. We picked our patch in the playroom and sat in front of the television, hoping that the soundtrack, coupled with the ominous glow flooding the room, would distract us from the gurgling mucus with each breath that our dad took. Scanning through the terrestrial channels, we came across the Universal logo circa 1990 to the thudding of deep drums. At this point, it should be pointed out that Ron Howard’s Apollo 13 is up there with The Great Escape, Shrek and Mission: Impossible as a film for which the BBC broadcasts on a regular basis. I saw it many times before this night and it is a film for which I might have to thank Ron Howard some day. \r\n\r\nNow, far from me to neatly sensationalise my dad’s last night with my fascination with film, but watching Apollo 13 that night keeps coming back to me as one of the reasons I am very grateful for film. Even with all its flaws, I would happily watch Apollo 13 every year than, say, Citizen Kane or Sátántángo (by the way, I don’t believe Susan Sontag’s statement about that film one bit*). Apollo 13 is hardly a supreme work of art, but for me it doesn’t have to be. While the film is undeniably a crowd-pleasing spectacle and a reconstruction of a historical event, it touches upon the personal and professional reaction to a crisis: the ‘personal’ being the families and the ‘professional’ being the crew at the Mission Control Centre. The astronauts, in a sense, encapsulate both. What do these three figures represent? Let’s just say, from my perspective, the family is just as it is. The flight crew are the doctors/nurses who work with proficient integrity to solve the problems. My dad is roughly along the lines of the astronauts. The space is the area beyond our physical reach for which my dad is, spiritually, floating through. These are romantic comparisons, but once the predicament of the Apollo 13 kicks in, it is a film which captures the stress and emotional turmoil of an ongoing event.\r\n\r\nOf course, the biggest difference between my dad’s situation and Apollo 13 is that Apollo 13 made it back home. Plus, my dad’s death is hardly of international interest. Perhaps you, the reader, are thinking this is too loose a comparison to make. Yet, it is the experience of sitting down in front of a television, in your pyjamas, waiting with slight trepidation as to whether your own life is about to transverse into the next era. Apollo 13 managed to do to me what you hear the complacent presenters babble on about the Academy Awards: escape. Ron Howard was right on cue at this point in my life, but the more I think about Apollo 13 the more I think that it was the most appropriate film depict the emotional chaos of trying to save or prolong something. This is one concrete line that I can comfortably relate to during our family’s turbulent year. It would be trite to call Apollo 13 allegorical. As you can tell, I’m barely tracing a connection. Temperamental moments during personal tragedies or struggles are meant to detach outsider involvement. The astronauts are stuck in a tin box arguing, consoling and striving to lengthen their journey bit by bit while the world is holding their breath. \r\n\r\nIn the film, a humorous moment comes from outright frustration. This is when the flight surgeon from Mission Control keeps telling the three men to sleep. In response, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) rips off his bio med sensors: “I am sick and tired of the entire western world knowing how my kidneys are functioning”. At this point, the doctor panics while, on the other hand, Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) gives a knowing chuckle. What is great about this scene is that this happening during a critical situation and yet Jim’s anger comes from constant close observation. It is a moment which smacks of “What is the use?” Amalgams of attitudes fly in the face of danger and death. As a family, we have endured through paradoxical emotions such as tears and humour. It reflects the absurdness of a premature demise. \r\n\r\nIn the end, Apollo 13 means more to me as a film depicting the dealing of a crisis than an historical document. Whether that be the cut out in communication as the Lunar Module drifts into the dark side of the moon while Jim’s wife is crying in the other room, or staff members at Mission Control lying asleep on the floor while the others are working around the clock to come up with solutions. I also willingly embrace the film as being about a father who is practically on the brink of death and absence. You could say that Jim Lovell and his crew return, symbolically, to those “trumpets” mentioned before from Pilgrim’s Progress. When the movie was over I could finally go to sleep knowing that tomorrow, my dad will be gone. \r\nThe next morning, I woke up to the sound of staff attending to his bedside in the playroom. He was still in a comatose state. Meanwhile, my grandpa had come to pick us children up while mum stayed by our dad’s side. We left the hospice and were treated to a hearty brunch at the local pub. We finished our main course and started to order our pudding. That was when the phone rang…\r\n\r\n\r\n* “I’d be glad to see it (Sátántángo) every year for the rest of my life”\r\n','Doctor Sleep',90,5,'2013-07-27 05:33:00'),('1j86wx','Look upon this list of sequels/prequels/reboots and tell me why we keep doing this to ourselves','* Indiana Jones 4\r\n* Total Recall\r\n* Rocky\r\n* Rambo\r\n* Alien Resurrection\r\n* Alien Vs.

I recently pondered a query about our favorite super human alien, the Man of Steel. We all know that Superman was born on Krypton, thats all well and good. We also know that Kryptonite is just shattered fragments of his home planet. Many different sources have told Superman\'s story, but all of them say that it is our Earths yellow sun that gives Kal El his fantastic abilities. Even in the newest movie it says that the radiation from the sun fuels his body, and due to the minimal gravity and materials of this world, he can fly, has super strength, etc. But answer me this, if Kryptonite is nothing but his shattered home planet, why does it have any effect on him on Earth. The thing that made Kryptonians the way they are on their planet was the materials of the planet, the gravity, and their red star. Even if this material did sap their body of their power, Kryptonite is the main material of their planet, everything was made of it. So wouldn\'t the Kryptonian battle suits diminish the warriors abilities? The point being, Kryptonite isn\'t some magic material that sucks the life force of Kryptonians, it\'s just a rock. And, not only does the evidence I\'ve given support my claim, but their have been quotes saying that if Superman spends enough time around Kryptonite, he would die, why not the same for his WHOLE SPECIES!? The species would have died our long ago if this were true. That being said, please discuss to your hearts content, and if anything should disprove my theories, please say so.','The Sun Is Also a Star',0,2,'2013-08-02 13:28:47'),('1jl5ie','I Made a Map of Disney\'s Animated Movies.

Lex Luthor is rallying the world against Superman with the help of a kryptonian intelligence he recovered from the remains of Kal-El\'s ship that crashed into Metropolis during the finale of MOS, an intelligence we know as Brainiac. Brainiac helps Lex to make Superman appear to be the biggest threat the world has ever known. Bruce buys into all of this at first despite his own suspicions about Lex and has a bone to pick with Superman after the collateral damage done to Metropolis, and his general distrust of beings from other planets. \r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of Kryptonite, Bruce utilizes it along with his near limitless arsenal of other tech to put down Superman under the guise of his alter-ego, veteran crimefighter Batman. Lex declares it a victory for the planet Earth and promises Superman\'s possible reign of terror has been nipped in the bud. \r\n\r\nBruce begins to question his role in all of this as Superman disappears following his defeat. He has been placed into an underground super prison constructed by Brainiac and Luthor, to be studied (and tortured). Brainiac has plans of his own and has used Luthor\'s funding to construct his own military force, planning to take the earth for his own.\r\n\r\nAs the stage is set, Batman breaks Superman out of his prison and the two set aside their past differences to put a stop to the technopocalypse being put in motion by Brainiac. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\'ll stop here, but this is a likely scenario I could see playing out as it allows Batman to beat Superman, save Superman, and for the world to be saved by Superman. Making both of them look badass while not discrediting either one (after all, Batman had legitimate concerns about Superman due to Luthor\'s rhetoric and his own paranoia). That\'s the key thing the movie has to be able to do, make both of them look good while also clashing.','Super Intelligence',0,12,'2013-08-25 14:52:54'),('1laz5s','I know that this may be a long shot..but can someone explain to me how the 6 basic principles are shown in National Treasure?','I have to write an essay for government..and this is the only information that I can\'t seem to understand/find.','Long Shot',0,0,'2013-08-28 22:34:10'),('1livvy','Introducing /r/MovieDirectory: A Place to Explore & Promote Movie Related Subreddits (237 Subs & Counting!)','###Greetings from /r/MovieDirectory!\r\n\r\nI\'ve started r/MovieDirectory to serve as a directory of all movie related subs, a place to explore and promote movie subreddits.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help us index the ever growing list of movie related subreddits.

It grew out of an idea that is prevalent on the internet and in real life. A terrifying and grave idea that is becoming more and more popular as ordinary individuals like myself are, with the time passed, overcoming the shock and horror of the day and making observations that awaken within us a true and unexpected terror.\r\n\r\n \'God Help Us\' Indiegogo campaign:\r\nigg.me/at/godhelpus\r\n\r\nThe idea is that 9/11 was a setup, an inside job.  It\'s become a commonly uttered phrase. Nearly everyone I know feels that it was - for certain - and even those who are unsure are aware of the day\'s inconsistencies to the extent that they hold their serious suspicions.\r\n\r\nThe implications of that situation are indescribably grave and terrifying. To consider that in our inebriation celebrating, consumption driven society that our comfortable lives are made possible by a great deception and the unspeakably atrocious, dirty work of empire is a cold, dark, painful realization. But it is one that cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nToday the observations I make as an ordinary individual make me very sad, angry, and upset. With the popularity of the idea and the grave implications that it carries I can not figure out why people can discuss the topic so casually. To speak on it as though it is fact and then do nothing. As we think - and live - and follow - it begs the question of where insanity begins. \r\n\r\nSo I did that which I\'m able to do and which I enjoy doing. I put together a film project, an effort that requires the fullest commitment of everything I\'ve ever been to produce something for the intent of communicating with other people. I\'ve developed it using another idea prevalent on the internet. One mysterious and vague and seldom understood and one that I care greatly about - the idea of Anonymous.\r\n\r\nWith the film I\'ve played my subtleties close to the chest. The film doesn\'t address anything about 9/11 specifically but rather is meant as just an emotional reaction to the scenario at hand. The tone is remarkably sad and hopeless and it is set in a world where it has become common knowledge that 9/11 was a setup. More information on the story is available on the indiegogo page: igg.me/at/godhelpus.\r\n\r\nI\'ve chosen crowd funding to get the film made with the intent that ordinary people committing their earned money makes the endeavor much more meaningful and makes it into a vehicle whereby the frustrated and silenced have a means to make their voices heard. My intent was to communicate with the elites in a language which they understand: money. The project is not for profit, the statement of that decision being that if in fact 9/11 was a setup then it is imperative that we abandon our normal greed and ego driven pursuits solely because those ambitions are over. They\'re done, the system is broken and until we can collectively assess and rectify the system that we are all so dependent on then normal pursuits of comfort should be put aside by the able.\r\n\r\nI want the project to be something in our culture whereby collectively people can express a painful sentiment that should no longer be ignored. With yet another endless war looming the time is now for those of us who are aware and awake and frustrated to make our voices heard. Nobody knows the full facts - and this project doesn\'t deal with facts but rather the feelings that the glaring things like building 7 and the size of the hole in the pentagon produce.\r\n\r\nWhether my story and the aesthetics of my filmmaking can connect with people on a scale broad enough to achieve my intended goal is a question that can be answered only after it has received proper exposure. I implore you to support this project by sharing or donating. Be creative!

She gets so much goddamn flak from people who have seen the movie. It\'s like they tuned out completely at the normal human experience just because they think Forrest is adorable.\r\n\r\n**Jenny didn\'t think she was in love with Forrest because she thought she was taking advantage of him the same way her father molested her.**\r\n\r\nFor fucks sake, Forrest is **ten**. Jenny, out of everyone who\'s ever met him, knows this best of all. She knows that her closest friend and only loved one is fucking **ten years old**. Imagine that. Imagine for one second that the only person who was always kind to you was someone who didn\'t know any better. Everyone in the world who knew about your father looked at you either as a victim or as something disgusting, but that one boy doesn\'t.\r\n\r\nAnd it\'s because he\'s **ten**.\r\n\r\nJenny doesn\'t think that way at the start. As a kid, she just thinks he\'s different and is just glad to have a friend. But as she gets older, especially as a teenager, she realizes that her closest friend will never mature like she does. He loves her like he would anything and everything else, so long as its nice or cuddly, like a pet or a sibling, at least in her mind. Her father treated her like shit, and there was no way in hell others didn\'t do the same when they found out she was molested. She would have wanted to feel loved.\r\n\r\nThat\'s where she gets the abusive relationship crap. She wants so much to be loved that she doesn\'t understand that they are taking advantage of her. She thinks that as long as they aren\'t forcing her to have sex, that\'s normal. Getting beat on, pressured to drug addiction, and dragged around into whatever dangerously extreme political bands they\'re into is just fine, as long as they don\'t rape her. That\'s why she\'s so shocked when Forrest defends her from harm. Why would anyone do that if what they\'re doing to her is normal?\r\n\r\nShe keeps leaving Forrest behind because she convinces herself that he doesn\'t really love her. She convinces herself that his affections are shallow, since he would never be able to really understand love either. I mean really, how many of you honestly think someone who is **ten** could understand the complexities and nuances of love? There\'s no way they could. What they have is something simple, and Jenny doesn\'t think that could be real.\r\n\r\nAnd even IF she believed he could, even IF she got out of that abusive cycle, she knows better. FFS, if that scene with Forrest and her in her college dormroom had the genders reversed, people would be so fucking uncomfortable about that scene because it\'d be inching so close to rape. Jenny knows that. She realizes that. That is why she shuts off her feelings for Forrest, above any other reasons to stay away: she thinks she is molesting him. She saw how uncomfortable he was when she did that and thought holy fuck, what the hell am I doing?\r\n\r\nCan you imagine how twisted you must feel after realizing in that moment that you turned into the father who molested you? How the fuck can you love yourself after doing that to your best friend, when you know what that\'s like? Would you ever let yourself get close to them again if you really cared about them?\r\n\r\nSo Jenny kept running away. Every time Forrest gets close and saves her, she runs off before she falters. She won\'t let herself get near him, and as the movie goes on, she fails a little more each time. First she blows him off after the strip club, telling him to stay away. Then she walks with him in DC, but still leaves with her boyfriend. Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him, after that one critical moment.\r\n\r\nWhen he tells her he does know what love is, and asks her why she doesn\'t love him.\r\n\r\nShe finally gives in and does sleep with him, but can you imagine thinking afterwards? Would you, in her shoes, with absolute and unwavering certainty, think you did the right thing? Or would you be afraid that you did exactly what you had been avoiding because you do actually care that much about him?\r\n\r\nSo she runs away. She hides her child from him, because she thinks he shouldn\'t have to worry or pay for something he can\'t handle. She thinks she\'s wronged him, and the least she could do is set things right by raising a good child, without dragging him down.\r\n\r\nAnd then she gets sick. Doctors don\'t know what it is, but she\'s going to die. Her kid is only a few years old. Can you imagine struggling with that decision to tell your victim that they have a kid and now they have to take care of it because you\'re going to die? That\'s what she struggles with before coming to terms with the fact that she\'s happy with him, and he\'s happy with her, and that\'s what love actually is. It\'s something simple and unconditional, and even Forrest can understand it.\r\n\r\nIt takes her her whole goddamn life to figure out that love is just that simple, and she dies months afterwards. She realized she had been running away from what made her happy, and it isn\'t wrong, and she only gets so much time together before it\'s over.\r\n\r\nAnd instead of realizing that narrative even exists in the story, people just bitch about how Jenny is such a slut, but she won\'t even love the only person who cares about her. Jenny always loved Forrest, during the whole fucking movie. She loved him so much, she thought she was taking advantage of him and ran away for his sake. She didn\'t realize she was wrong until it was almost too late.\r\n\r\nFuck, that\'s depressing.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Obligatory gushing, but actually I just wanted to add a TL;DR:\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Jenny thought she was molesting Forrest because he couldn\'t understand what love is, so she either suppressed her feelings or ran away.','Doctor Sleep',0,3,'2013-11-19 01:15:30'),('1r58u7','Remake Of The Abominable Snowman In The Works','','Abominable',3,3,'2013-11-21 11:01:22'),('1r6h8i','J.R.R.

Like many images in the film it has a dual meaning of idealising the nuclear family and allowing an “emasculated” modern man explore his traditional fantasies as a lone warrior with out the problems of real life interfering.\r\n\r\nThe man with no name, The Kid as he is often called by his “adoptive father figure” the mechanic is the central character and also the place holder for the viewer – male, with out ties and possibly some disposable income, but not rich (he never keeps the money). He is our Clint Eastwood and in many ways closely resembles “The Preacher” in Pale Rider and others with a rugged masculinity, few words and a tooth pick. The overtly religious Preacher is replaced by a more secular fallen angel here as seen when The Kid lifts an circular inspection light to reveal a crooked halo above him. Religion does play a role (though back ground) in Drive, one character is annoyed he is refered to as a “kike” and others are seen with crosses on them, no mistake in a thoroughly planned film like this.\r\n\r\nAs in Pale Rider a family is being protected, in the earlier film it was a reconstituted family, the couple unmarried (maybe living in sin!) with a daughters emerging desires as a central theme. In drive the dfamily may at first seem similarly chaotic with the father in Prison and a possible love triangle emerging. In reality it is far more traditional, certainly in terms of gender roles. Irene is literally the Virgin Mary, seen as largely unsexual (except for one brief moment) pure and a doting mother. In opposition to the other 2 women seen she is idealised into being a surrogate mother for all of us.\r\n\r\nThe other women fare less well. Blanche is duplicitous and the other woman... or women are overtly sexualised, naked and available for the viewing pleasure of us the viewer and their owner/manager Cook. Blanche can be seen as the less idealised more realistic surrogate mother or wife of The Kid. They are forced into some sort of partnership when they are on the run, in some sort of home, the semi domestic motel room. In this scene we see the first sudden and highly manipulative violence that he Kid can bring, it is no surprise that this is a domestic violence like slap commited on a woman first in the narrative on a double (matrimonial/sexual) bed. The kids violence has been learned or maybe taught, he has seen it in his own domestic life of his childhood and he plays it out again with Blanche manipulating a duplicitous woman. The close camera work showing a pointed finger and clenched fist aping the intimate role we have in the scene.\r\n\r\nThe idea of familial violence, chaotic families and male physicality are all instrumental in creating the drama in the film. As The Kid idolises Irene he cannot see that he is destroying the family, it is The Kid that sets in motion its demise with the offer of help to rob a pawn shop and plan to do it. Even when he is doing this not to integrate himself into it but to allow the newly emerged father/husband to take his place with in it. At first there is a possible romance developing between him and Irene but this can never be sexual due to the idealised virgin mother and the inability of The Kid to take it further. In fact it is only Irene that tries to break her role tenderly taking the Kids hand on the gear stick on a night time drive. The Kid wants to not become the father or husband but repair the shattered family that he once had.\r\n\r\nThere is no way this can ever happen as anything The Kid comes into contact with is destroyed. Cars, he is intending to become a stock car racer! heads, hands and lives. In one early scene he is seen next to a picture of wilting flowers, a possible shadow of the wilted Irene, or more likely the life sucking ability of The Kid, he is also seen continuously with EXIT signs. These are hints about him and his views not about Irene, the film is explicitly self centered.\r\n\r\nThere could be many ways to account for The Kids lack of emotion, propensity to violence and lack of forsight. One easy to dismiss could be some kind of congenital psychological problem like autism. While he is of few words, fascinated by cars ans engine and also a fascination with Neon colours and the dimming of bright lights when he finally kisses Irene, it is too easy to say he is Autistic. This would not account for his violence or the way he can easily manipulate people. Another discarded idea is that he is a psychopath, he is seen wearing a mask very similar to Haloweens killer Michael Myers in many scenes in afilm that is very reflexive Again this is to simplistic as he is assuming a role, using it to his advantage. The Kid is not devoid of emotions just unable to control them or maybe see the consequences of them.\r\n\r\nAll of the kids emotion problems stem from the earlier hinted at chaotic familiy life that emerges in the Motel room. While this may seen like a bold statement it is empty as the film suggests that men are better off with out a family and in a traditional male individualistic role. Irenes husband is fatal punished for wanting to be a family man trying to erase a debt so he can devote himself to his “new” family.\r\n\r\nAll men are unencumbered by women with the exception of Cook that has the dead weight of Blanche counter balanced by the availability of the dancers/prostitutes he works with, naked and prone to his advances. Both of these are his down fall as Blanche betrays him and his pursuit of more earthly pleasures leaves his hand ungaurded for a hammer attack. His onanistic hand later seen in bandage just before he is killed with a fork to the eye and knife to the body, surely emasculated as he is penetrated by the knife. Further emasculation / asexualisation is seen with The Kids boss and father figure. Again a single man he has earlier had his pelvis “smashed” giving him a limp (it is telling that he did not have an arm or knee cap broken) later he dies bleeding out when he is slashed with a razor.\r\n\r\nAll other men are seen as single lone wolves, none have children or wives. Sex is seen as a distraction by duplicitous women sapping men of their strength. Far better to have an ideal Irene the Virgan Mary than an actual relationship – Irene an actual flesh and blood wife. Drive is highly reactionary against women idealising the family. The neon colours hark back to the eighties the last decade we had a true manly action man in the shape of Arnie or Stallone. The cars, the most totemic phallic symbols are even older from the 70s and even 50s with the “pussy wagon” cadilac. They are from a time of Vanishing Point another film about a silent driver.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that The Kid has no name is so that a male viewer can become the driver, safe from destroying his own family life; but able to live out his fantasies while still identifying with the diminished role that many men now feel they have after the demise of tradition male employment such as mechanic – manual... MANual in nature. If The Kid lives or dies at the end imagining a fairy tale ending in his dying moments it does not matter as the effect is still the same. The family has been dismantled just like an engine block, written off like a car. Irene is still controlled by the grief of two men leaving her life, un-sexual from their demise. The Kid has done this before hinted at with Shannon the mechanics description of his mysterious arrival.

The shadow of blacklisting and morality had been thrown off and gave rise to a new era of politicised films such as The Parallax View, All The Presidents Men, The Godfather with its fall of the American dream The Conversation, Reds or Three Days of the Condor.\r\n\r\nThese were the blockbusters of their day before the blockbuster emerged. With the most prominent directors, cast, budgets and prestige. They were released at a time of political polarisation providing an American voice about American politics in the aftermath of Vietnam, Watergate and the Oil Crisis\r\n\r\nAgain America is in a time of political polarisation, post 9/11, post Katrina, post war in the gulf... twice, post economic slump. With the first black president, female Secretary of State and rise of the Tea Party. Political thrillers have fallen from view replaced by blockbusting franchises. American directors have lost their political voice and they are now the preserve of smaller films, pet projects of George Clooney making Syrianna or the more uplifting tale from Argo. Politics is silent in the blockbuster that now dominates Hollywood. An American director is apolitical and a discourse is now left to those who are foreign to provide a voice some what insulated from domestic criticism – non partisan.\r\n\r\nMarvel films can be seen as the dominant mode of film. Multi-stranded and multi-billion dollar in revenue. They project a classic American beach head into the global film market. The American directors John Favrau (twice) Shane Black, Joe Johnson and Josh Whedon (and it must be added the non American directors of these franchises too) provide a classic view of America. Iron Mans Tony Stark can be seen as the embodiment of this, a brash company owner selling arms with out the need for complex morals. In the first film Stark Industries creates a threat not through a fault of capitalism but one bad apple in the form of Odediah Stane and foreign terrorists It is a soothing tale of American values.\r\n\r\nAnother massive franchise Transformers by the US Michael Bay takes this further. Transformers II shows an American exceptionalism when an American senator can order the transformers to leave the whole plant. He is a global spokesman located on the British naval base of Diego Garcia speaking for the whole world. The initial opening scene set in China has only American characters and Optimus Lincoln fighting the global threat of “terrorism” in American hardware with out any international help or seemingly permission granted from the Chinese. The films is painted with broad strokes but perhaps shows its world view easily because of this.\r\n\r\nThe 2 Dark Knight films can be seen as perhaps different to those films and is directed by the British Christopher Nolan – a director with a high degree of autonomy in his film making. Once again there is a scene set in China but in this Batman has to sneak into the location and also be rescued by a covert CIA. There is at least a nod to political realities. The main protagonist is also a home grown “terrorist” in the form of the Joker railing against the government institutions embodied in Harvey Dent. Just as Tony Stark is a millionaire industrialist so is Bruce Wayne but he does not “privatise defense” as Stark does but build the monorail public rail transport system as well as house Gothams utilities. More importantly he is trying to help Harvey Dent rebuild trust in the shattered police and justice system – public institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Knight Rises takes this further with a more overt political discussion with the introduction of the libertarian gone hey wire plans of Bane – some what Americanised from his original Mexican comic character. He asks Gothams citizens to take control and determine what they want also telling them that Gothams police will also be held hostage till they learn to serve their masters. The films show a discussion of differing political systems that could lie in the US future.\r\n\r\nThough smaller in budget South African Neill Blomkamp can be seen as even more overtly political. Elysium tells the story of a devastated USA as the rump state of the Utopian Elysium space colony. Elysium is a colony in all but name controlling the economy, air space and citizens of LA with a globalisation that has gone interstellar. It shows the flip side of a libertarian paradise and hell in which Max must travel from one to the other to cure his fatal dose of radiation. Caused by unregulated working conditions unhelped by failed public services in the form of the authoritarian police robots. The central theme of universal citizenship and health care a lightening rod for criticism of political preaching and a some what luke warm reception than his earlier film. District 9 a political satire of race relations and representation seems to have been more positively received as it dealt with South Africa. It could discuss politics as long as it was not with in the boarders on the USA.\r\n\r\nAs a control we can use The Lone Ranger directed by the American Gore Verbinski. It was cut from the rock as his earlier exceptionally popular and profitable Pirates of the Caribbean with lavish effects and stunts, jokes and acting calibre. It differed in one way – the depiction of America and the use of Tonto, a native American as the central character rather than the Lone Ranger himself\' seemingly reduced to a supporting role. The film cannot fail to be seen as political with a small “p” as it depicts the slaughter of Native Americans, has a home grown American thoroughly evil Cole and Cavendish as the antagonists. Cole is the antithesis of Tony Stark – an industrialist hell bent on profit and hostile take overs in the guise of modernisation. Add to that the General Custor like Fuller massacring Native Americans and you have a recipe for disaster at the box office. The Lone ranger was criticised heavily, recouping only half its budget perhaps in no small part to the politicisation with in its narrative. The narrative was certainly no worse than his popular and profitable Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End.\r\n\r\nAnother historical though thoroughly factual film is 12 Years A Slave. It has emerged as a front runner of Oscar predictions and is about the brutality of American slavery but directed by the black British Steve MacQueen, who is descended from Jamaican slaves. MacQueen directing seems to allow an authenticity and also a side stepping of American partisan politics that using an American director such as Spike Lee could or would have caused. It seems that the political Black voice seen in the Hughs Brothers and Spike Lee has withered away form politics. Lee directing the apolitical and Korean inspired Old Boy and the Hughs brothers making the post apocalyptic but also morally and religiously upstanding Book OF Eli.\r\n\r\nIt is telling that American directed Django Unchained uses slavery as a back drop to exploitation vengence rather than political discussion or that Spielberg recently directed the upstanding less politically divisive Lincoln recently rather than Amistad which had the good fortune to direct years ago.\r\n','Men in Black: International',1,4,'2014-01-08 20:22:19'),('1usu8j','Child\'s Play: The Degeneration of Blockbusters -- great read.','','Child\'s Play',11,3,'2014-01-09 10:30:20'),('1uuao4','The Hunt is now available to watch on Netflix Streaming.

And if I’m being honest, I am a little disappointed as well.  If it were me deciding, I’d give it to Her in a heartbeat; it’s a far more artistic and beautiful film.  That being said, I’m not too disappointed because American Hustle was my second favorite film of the year and to see people call it the “safe choice” or even go as far as to compare it to Argo bewilders me.  Argo was a film with little artistic merit; it was entertaining but has really no themes or anything to say.  It’s just a retelling of a historical event and that isn’t something that I would forsee being relevant as the years roll by.  However, whether you like it or not, American Hustle does have a lot of artistic merit; while not on the same level as Her, it actually has themes to express and things to say. \r\n\r\nFun trivia fact: American Hustle was originally titled “American Bullshit.”  As one can imagine, that title did not fly and the screenplay was blacklisted in 2008.  I knew that going into the film and I have to say that American Bullshit is a far more appropriate title.  This biggest complaint I’ve heard on Reddit about the film is that it doesn’t end in some big clever way, as the “Hustle” may suggest.  It’s unfortunate that the film had that sort of connotation, because it actuality it was a brilliant commentary on both the bullshit of the government and the bullshit of the American way.  The characters have to cheat their way to success and ultimately for Christian Bale’s character, he becomes so disgusted by it that he has to reject that way of life for another.  In fact, I challenge people on their next viewing of the film to listen every time a character uses the word “bullshit;” it always had meaning to it.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Her, I honestly believe that American Hustle was the best choice, not the “safest choice.”  I know the Wolf of Wall Street is Reddit’s newest craze and that’s okay, but there are many flaws with the film (and no, I’m not talking about content in the slightest).  Leo and Jonah are great, but there is a lot of sloppiness in the set up of certain things that leaves a lot to be desired, at least for me.  And this is coming from someone who had been craving for the movie since the first trailer premiered.  American Hustle and WoWS share similar ideas in terms of content and thematic ideas, but American Hustle does it way better.  Inside Llewyn Davis was good but not the Coen Brother’s best and I wouldn’t call it the best film of the year.  It’s enjoyable but not the best.  Same for Nebraska; my family loved it and while I really did like a lot about the film, it also wasn’t the best to me.\r\n\r\nIn the end, while I would have preferred to see Her take home the award, saying American Hustle was the safest choice or unworthy of winning isn’t giving the film any credit whatsoever.  Objectively, the film is well edited and well written.  And from my subjective perspective, it does have a lot of artistic value in terms of content which definitely makes it deserving of Best Picture.\r\n\r\nTL;DR American Hustle deserves its award.\r\n','The Hustle',0,10,'2014-01-13 20:57:48'),('1v66xn','A quick question about Inside Llewyn Davis (spoilers)','Hey!

Interested to hear other opinions.','The Hustle',0,13,'2014-01-26 13:18:27'),('1w9qe0','I could be wrong, but I think many people are missing a deeper meaning in the film “American Hustle.” (Spoiler Alert)','*SPOILER ALERT*\r\n\r\nFrankly, I found myself pleasantly surprised at how much I was thinking about this film long after it ended.  First of all, I’m not a big-time movie guy (I find most films silly and boring), and I know very little about cinema science (so I can’t really get into cinematography/lighting/acting/editing/etc).  However, when I read reviews of this film on Reddit, people seem to be focusing negatively on the plot, predictability or weak twists and turns.  I myself was expecting another hustle/heist/crime film before I watched it.  When it was all said and done…the movie appeared to have much deeper undertones…undertones that are almost disturbing.\r\n\r\nAmerican Hustle seems to tap into a more serious notion, that the mind of those who volunteer to uphold the law and those who knowingly break the law are similar in many ways.  The film affirms a deeper confession, in that many who serve in government/law enforcement/the church/authority/etc feel as though they are on the right side of righteousness.  And being on the right side of righteousness, gives one the right to do WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT…much like a criminal does.  This idea is portrayed through Bradley Cooper’s character in the film.\r\n\r\nCooper’s motives soon transcend from merely making right from wrong.  His eventual and deliberate efforts to ruin the lives of others, turns into a twisted journey, where he sees himself as above other citizens, colleagues and the law of the land.  He sought not just satisfaction in locking away people (innocent or guilty), he began to obsess over it.  Meanwhile, whatever HE wanted, was his for the taking (drugs/FBI resources/Amy Adams’ character).  However, his home life was not ideal, and illustrates an example of the classic, “those who can’t control themselves, can’t help but want to control others.”\r\n\r\nI’m amazed at how this mindset prevails in real life, not just Hollywood; from J. Edgar Hoover to Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  “The law is on my side.”  “Freedom and patriotism are on my side.”  “God is on my side.”  “Now?  I’m going to do WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT, and feel not only shamelessness, but exaltation and pride when I hurt others.”\r\n\r\nAnyhow…I was just wondering if you all felt the same way.  This discussion is hopefully all in good taste, and hopefully my opinion makes sense.

','The Hunt',5,9,'2014-02-10 20:41:51'),('1xpy5u','My Journey to Become a Movie Buff',' A hear or so ago, I hadn\'t really seen alot of significant movies, mostly sticking to blockbusters and what was in theaters at the time. This started to change, however, as I began to grow more of an interest in movies from the past that I hadn\'t seen. This might not seem like much to alot of movie buffs, but this is the first leg of my journey to becoming a fan of all things film. Below are the movies I have watched since I began this journey, along with a short review of each.\r\n\r\n*Reservoir Dogs* (1992): This was where I started my journey. I felt it was appropriate, being Tarantino\'s first film. It really kept my attention with the tight plot, interesting characters, and tense atmosphere.\r\n**My Grade: 9.1/10**\r\n\r\n*Pulp Fiction* (1994): After watching *Reservoir Dogs*, this was a pretty logical choice. I can see why it\'s one of the most important and acclaimed movies in history. The script and direction are just about perfect, the chracters are fully realized, and the way the events all wind together is amazing.\r\n**My Grade: 9.6/10**\r\n\r\n*The Truman Show* (1998): I get that this is a pretty weird choice after starting off with Tarantino, but it was better than I expected. Jim Carrey gives a career-best performance, and the satire works very well.\r\n**My Grade: 9.3/10**\r\n\r\n*Being John Malkovich* (1999): The premise of this film intrigued me, and I was glad to find out just how good it was. I love good sci-fi, and with the strange, surreal atmosphere Spike Jonze creates, this movie was a joy to watch from beginning to end.\r\n**My Grade: 9/10**\r\n\r\n*Donnie Darko* (2001): Honestly, this was my favorite out of all the films I watched on this journey. I know I\'ll sound like a fanboy when talking about *Donnie Darko*, but I just liked it so much. I loved the way it was shot, the way it was written, and the way that you just couldn\'t predict what would happen next. It\'s a shame the director was never able to recapture the magic.\r\n**My Grade: 9.6/10**\r\n\r\n*Face/Off* (1997): Now one of my favorite action films ever, this breakneck pile of ridiculousness is just so much fun to watch. The overacting, the over-the-top stunts and direction. It\'s like being on a Nicholas Cage and John Travolta rollercoaster.\r\n**My Grade: 8.7/10**\r\n\r\n*World Trade Center* (2006): I watched this right after *Face/Off*, and it\'s safe to say it was a mood whiplash. Still, it\'s an incredibly made movie, and tells just one story of the thousands that fateful day. Nicholas Cage gives a strong performance in the lead, and it manages to keep your attention even when it\'s just the actors stuck in wreckage.\r\n**My Grade: 8.4**\r\n\r\n*Big Fish* (2003): This was a movie that I just flat-out loved. It shows that Tim Burton doesn\'t always have to be dark and Tim Burton-y, and that he can tell a heart-warming story of father and son, telling fantastical stories of their lives. The ending may very well cause tears, so watch out if you plan on watching it.\r\n**My Grade: 9.1**\r\n\r\n*United 93* (2006): This was the second movie I watched about 9/11, and this one was the better of the two by far. Paul Greengrass\'s direction makes decent use of shaky-cam, and it is incredibly tense. You feel like you\'re living through the day all over again while watching it, which is the scariest thing of all.\r\n**My Grade: 9.3/10**\r\n\r\n*Bernie* (2011): This was a strange film. A black comedy about a pretty serious subject, it hits you with the jokes when they are there and drags you into the story. The best part, however, is Jack Black, who gives arguably his best performance in any film here.\r\n**My Grade: 8.3/10**\r\n\r\n*Adventureland* (2009): I really didn\'t know much about this movie going into watching it, but I\'m glad I did. It was a well-made dramedy with likable characters and a good story. Jesse Eisenberg (or possibly Michael Cera) gives a solid lead performance, and Kristen Stewart shows that she gets way too much hate as an actress, as she is great in her role. All-around likable movie.\r\n**My Grade: 8.4/10**\r\n\r\n*Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy* (2004): After hearing so much about it and seeing so many quotes and references, I finally gave in and watched *Anchorman*. It lived up to the hype, being an endlessly funny and quotable comedy with a fantastic cast. Will Ferrell has never been better and Steve Carell has quite possibly never been this funny. It\'s ridiculous and awesome combined.\r\n**My Grade: 8.9/10**\r\n\r\n*Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story* (2004): This was a solid comedy, although not quite as good as *Anchorman*. I liked the performances, especially Ben Stiller as the villain, but the story was a bit predictable. The jokes more than made up for that, though, making this a new comedy classic.\r\n**My Grade: 8.3/10**\r\n\r\n*Knocked Up* (2007): I found this a very likable movie. I\'d never watched anything else by Apatow, but this was a great introduction to his work. It\'s well written and features great lead performances by Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen. The supporting cast, which includes Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, and Paul Rudd, does fantastic. All-around, I loved it, but I will admit it went on a little too long and did feature some typical romantic comedy tropes.\r\n**My Grade: 8.7/10**\r\n\r\n*Zack and Miri Make a Porno* (2008): My first Kevin Smith film, this was a good way to familiarize myself with Smith\'s style. It\'s not only funny, but features some likable characters and a decent story. Unfortunately, it falls victim to romantic comedy cliches at times, which takes it down a little.\r\n**My Grade: 8/10\r\n\r\n*Trainspotting* (1996): Another first for me, this time with Danny Boyle. This is an interesting film, a black comedy that isn\'t afraid to repulse the viewer. With withdrawl hallucinations, dead babies, and disgusting toilets, this is a very ugly film at times, which is part of the reason why it\'s so good. The perfomances are top-notch, the script is great, and Boyle does a good job directing. It\'s a film that convinced me not to do drugs.\r\n**My Grade: 9.2/10**\r\n\r\n*Man on the Moon* (1999): This movie was fascinating. I\'d never really heard of Andy Kaufman before it, but after I felt like I knew him. Jim Carrey is fantastic, and it makes me wonder how Carrey would\'ve turned out had he decided to become a dramatic actor from the start. It may not be entirely accurate, but it keeps the viewer interested in the life of a very peculiar man.\r\n**My Grade: 8.6/10**\r\n\r\n*Platoon* (1986): An eye-opener of a film, this Vietnam war drama kept my attention throughout with both the direction of Oliver Stone and the performances of lead actors Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willem Dafoe. Featuring some thought-provoking ideas on war and the American Dream through the eyes of Chris Taylor, this is one to watch.\r\n**My Grade: 9.2/10**\r\n\r\n*Fargo* (1995): Low-key and fantastically written, this Coen brothers masterpiece takes a dodgy situation and takes it way out of hand, showing an insurance scheme going way out of hand and ending with death and multiple people on the run from the law. Come for the wood-chipper scene, stay for the interesting characters and script.\r\n**My Grade: 9.2/10**\r\n\r\n*The Hunger Games* (2012): The most recent movie on here, I enjoyed this film, but will admit that I enjoyed the book better. This is a flawed film, cutting out alot of important points and laying it on way too hard with the shaky-cam at points. The cast does a solid job and it keeps your interest, but it could have been better. I do want to see *Catching Fire*, given the great reviews.\r\n**My Grade: 7.7/10**\r\n\r\n*American Psycho* (2001): I\'d heard so much about it, and just had to give it a watch. This movie is really fascinating. I loved watching it, and being how strange and off-kilter it is, it keeps you invested. Obviously, the highlight is Christian Bale, who is perfectly cast as Patrick Bateman. Darkly comic and very violent, this is a great watch.\r\n**My Grade: 8.9/10**\r\n\r\n*World\'s Greatest Dad* (2009): Another dark comedy, this is a film that satires the cult status of people after they die, and does it very well. It takes an unlikable jerk who everybody hated, and turns him into a messiah in their eyes. Robin Williams is fantastic, giving one of his best performances here. There\'s so much to like in a movie filled with hate.\r\n**My Grade: 8.1/10**\r\n\r\n*Spaceballs* (1987): I have to say, I was kinda disappointed with this movie. Although it is funny and it is quotable, it wasn\'t quite as funny as I thought it would be. Now, not to say I didn\'t like it. Rick Moranis is hilarious as Dark Helmet, and the rest of the cast holds up. It can, however, be boring at times, and not all of the jokes hit. I still liked it, though.\r\n**My Grade: 8/10**\r\n\r\n*Slumdog Millionaire* (2008): An endlessly watchable drama with a feel-good story and a great cast, this rags-to-riches tale kept my interest from beginning to end. I liked the narrative structure, which kept the events of Jamal\'s childhood out of order, giving us a look at all different times of his life. Sometimes it can slip into schmaltzy territory, but most of the time it\'s fantastic.\r\n**My Grade: 8.8/10**\r\n\r\n*The Dictator* (2012): This was a stupid movie. Of course, it was also hilarious, but it was also stupid. It seemed every joke had to step up to the line and backflip across it, taking out any semblance of decency. Of course, there was actually good satire in there, and that helps it out. Sacha Baron Cohen is perfect in the lead, and the supporting cast does alright too. It\'s just a stupid but hilarious film.\r\n**My Grade: 8.2/10**\r\n\r\n*Zoolander* (2001): The film I last watched, this is a great comedy with a talented cast and a surprisingly interesting story. Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell are all great, and their characters are hilarious. It\'s quotable, funny, and re-watchable.\r\n**My Grade: 8.2/10**\r\n\r\nThis is only the first leg of my journey to become a big movie buff. With every film I see for the first time, I pick up more and more. My desire to become a film student is only growing, and this is how it continues to grow. I\'d appreciate criticsm on my ratings and reviewing style, as well as any movies you\'d suggest for me to watch, preferably those on Netflix Instant.

I\'m here to set the record straight on how things REALLY happened when you pull back the David/Goliath marketing and see things for what they are.\r\n\r\nJafar is a wealthy man. He is powerful. He is respected. He is learned. For all his assets, however, he is forced to watch helplessly as the banking crisis of 1000 BCE slowly destroys a thousand year old city, the hub of civilization at the time in point of fact, where math, written language, beer (yes, beer) and science arguably all have their roots: Jafar\'s beloved city of Agrabah is one of the oldest cities on earth, birthplace of a million human memes, a wellspring of culture and art and a shining monument to humanity\'s cooperative potential. \r\n\r\nAnd it\'s all going to hell.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the film Jafar is watching the ruler of his beloved country play with toys, bubble to himself about his hat and entertain his spoiled brat daughter with exotic and therefore expensive (imported) pets while urchins and beggars die in obscurity just beyond the high stone walls of the Palace. While the riots of this time period aren\'t made explicit in *Aladdin* (beyond the fact that the \'hero\' is a beggar himself and that the guards are more concerned with law-as-written, protecting elites and corruption than the wellbeing of those they were originally created to protect or the spirit of the law, references to the usury punishment of hand amputation and inhumane prisons, to name a few, and there are others) the theme is still actively present: Agrabah is in dire straits. Zoro bandit heroes do not arise in cultures where there is no injustice of governance.\r\n\r\nSo what does Jafar do? He attempts to gain the final bit of power he needs to turn the tide: A genie to do the impossible and make him the de facto King of Agrabah. What he intends to do with this power is never mentioned beyond usurping the incompetent ruler. In fact, he doesn\'t say he\'s going to do ANYTHING with it, but his statement is that he wants to rule Agrabah to preserve it from idiocy, more or less, implying there are some tough decisions to be made and the King is vastly incompetent to make them. \r\n\r\nNever does Jafar imply he wants to kill, crush or oppress anyone. While he may be the head of the secret police-like Palace Guards, they are, unto themselves, a corrupt and difficult to manage group at best and he knows the only way to trust them is to utterly dominate them, for just as they have betrayed the King for Jafar, they may in turn betray Jafar if he DOES pull off a coup, because in the eyes of the people, Jafar is not a royal and in many ways the Palace Guards are an institution of royalty. Should the people turn on the Palace, Jafar would unquestionably be offered up as a scapegoat while the palace guards continued to rule or escaped safely as the situation demanded.\r\n\r\nhttp://s9.postimg.org/m6eszerv3/Jafar.jpg\r\n\r\n^This ^is ^Grand ^Vizier ^Jafar ^of ^Agrabah ^and ^he ^is ^understandably ^pissed ^off ^at ^the ^ruling ^class.\r\n\r\nFaced with such an impossible task, Jafar turns to the one place he can find impossible answers: Magic. He proceeds to spend an amount of time that is implied to be decades searching for the source of power he\'d need to alter reality itself and obtain the throne.\r\n\r\nEnter the villain, Aladdin, a beggar, slacker and thief who justifies robbing other poor folk, such as apple sellers working hard in the sun selling product which, I might add, they had to originally purchase themselves! Note they are selling, not growing, apples; where in Agrabah are apples grown? The palace historically dipped into trade equity as heavily as the merchant class and, meagerly and at the beginning of the chain, the farmers themselves most likely made even less than the sellers. Rather than pursuing more noble methods of earning capital, such as seeking employment, learning a craft or, if things truly are That Bad, becoming a politician or supporting the rise of one, Aladdin has chosen an idyllic life of parasitism.\r\n\r\nIt\'s taken for granted by the viewer that he has no choice but to steal, but we don\'t actually know that for sure, it\'s just what Aladdin claims. And Aladdin is a self-admitted con-man so really, can\'t trust a damn word he says.\r\n\r\nConsider: If Aladdin has no choice but to steal to survive then the situation in Agrabah truly IS as dire as described above and **Jafar is justified in his attempt to dethrone a despot at worst and an unempathetic and oblivious moron at best**. \r\n\r\nIf he DOES have a choice then **Al\'s morally bankrupt at worst and irresponsibly selfish at best**, getting a conscience only when confronted with a literal younger version of himself and giving the child bread. In all other cases of lawlessness, Aladdin is acting selfishly, and it\'s possible only by seeing himself mirrored in that orphan is he capable of empathy because of how deeply selfish he is.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FxeDQvt.gif\r\n\r\n^This ^is ^probably ^a ^more ^accurate ^depiction ^of ^Aladdin.\r\n\r\nThroughout the story Aladdin and Jafar battle for possession of a lamp, one intending to use the genie within to rebirth Agrabah and lop off the head of corruption in the Palace, the other intending to use it to brainwash, coerce, trick or otherwise manipulate a beautiful and rich girl he barely knows. \r\n\r\nGranted, at the end of the movie after Aladdin traps Jafar into eternal servitude he releases the Genie, sacrificing his chance to marry Jasmine, but a right does not justify a wrong. While Genie is now free, Jafar must spend eternity (eternity!) in servility or confinement or both, with little hope of redemption. And of course there\'s always the fact that Jasmine loved him by that point, so who cares what the King says? At every stage a by turns befuddled, disenfranchised and wronged Jafar is tricked into the ultimate hell by a lying thief.\r\n\r\nBut /u/zenaggression, you cry, what about the fact that Jafar betrayed Aladdin in the first place! He always intended to leave Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders to die! True! Jafar had in fact already fed another thief to the same cave. I want you to put yourself in his shoes a moment: The ruler of a country must occasionally make tough decisions, and it would hardly do for Jafar to achieve the throne only to have a rabble-rouser spill the beans to the entire populace that his throne was a ruse of magic, likely causing them to lose all faith in the throne and ultimately galvanize to riot their own city into ruin. It\'s no less justified than his plan to murder the King in a way, and possibly even MORE vital to the overall goal of redeeming Agrabah.\r\n\r\nSo you can see that neither side is evil in their own minds, however objectively it may appear Jafar is evil or Aladdin benevolent after Disney gets their hands on poor Jafar\'s legacy. That is what makes Aladdin a good story: It\'s a true-feeling story. It\'s memetic because it\'s probably based on actual events that happened and it\'s plausible because, arguably, there\'s no person in the story who considers themselves evil in any sense of the word. Nobody thinks they are evil. They may say out loud, I do evil things, but in their hearts if they believed what they were doing were objectively wrong they would NOT do it. Desire does not trump morality, it is not a litmus test for reality, it IS reality.\r\n\r\nI therefore put this to you: Write a story about good and evil if you want to be remembered by children. Write a story about morality and making tough choices if you want to be remembered by adults. Blend them together and you\'ll have a truly eternal work of storytelling for all ages.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading villain fans! \r\n\r\nAlso in this series: [Disney\'s *Peter Pan* - Villain Redemption Part II - Captain Hook, Hero in a Savage World](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/216jy8/disneys_peter_pan_villain_redemption_part_ii/)','The Secret Life of Pets 2',98,66,'2014-03-22 21:20:10'),('217fox','I put together a list of my favorite war movies, here they are.

MY INTENTION WAS NO SPOILERS BUT, JUST IN CASE.\r\n\r\nWhile many seemed to enjoy X-Men: First Class (2011), I on the other hand was extremely disappointed. I loved the premise, most of the cast and small portions of the film, but in the end, I felt like it was an unbalanced attempt to re-spark a film franchise that miserably failed its fans with X-Men: The Last Stand. Just my opinion. However, holy crap snacks! X-Men: Days of Future Past is light-years superior to both those films and is a high-contender for one of the best films this summer.\r\n\r\nDirected by Bryan Singer (as you may remember, the director of X-Men and X-Men 2) and loosely based on a 1981 two-issue storyline (issues 141-142) in the pages of the Uncanny X-Men, Days of Future Past is a highly-engaging, high-concept summer flick that should satisfy hardcore and mainstream audiences alike. With a returning cast which includes Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Patrick Stewart and many more, this film has raised the bar in terms of balancing a large cast while telling a interesting story.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I am shocked at how good it is.\r\n\r\nThe film in a nutshell:\r\nThe future is bad. Real bad. Mechanized, mutant hunting peacekeepers called Sentinels have evolved and nearly wiped out both mutant and human populations. It seems in our government\'s attempt to control fear, that fear became realized and backfired. Now, only humans with no trace of a mutant strain are allowed to exist. The last of the X-Men are trying to survive and, in a last ditch effort to save the future, Wolverine must go to the past, bring friends, now enemies back together and stop an event that triggered the domino effect of hate. Effin\' Groovy!\r\n\r\nThe Good:\r\nFirst and foremost, the best part of this film is how the mutant powers are showcased. Leaked onto the Web near a month ago, audiences were allowed to watch an opening sequence where six X-Men try to hold off a Sentinel attack. I wish I never saw that. Seeing it on the big screen is fantastic and I spoiled it for myself. Fluid and seamless, the X-Men each showcase their skills as a team in a gorgeous way that had never been shown in this franchise. A huge standout is Bingbing Fan\'s Blink and how the director and writers choose to show how she uses her abilities for herself and her team.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of powers - Quicksilver is flippin\' wonderful! While his costume in the released promotional photos looks ridiculous and sad, Evan Peters\' portrayal is both fun and another shining moment for the film. Not even close to the arrogant, snobby, aristocratic Quicksilver I grew up with in the comics, this different take on a young mutant is a ton of fun. I really enjoyed how he was used and, in comparison to First Class, why he as a character was relevant to the overall story - a problem I have with most of mutants showcased in that 2011 film.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s just stuff that happens in the first half of the film. I haven\'t even gotten to how well Hugh Jackman carries this film or how, in comparison to X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine (2013) the character of Wolverine is able to be highlighted and well represented. Nor have I even mentioned how the rest of this all-star cast, regardless of the amount of screen time, add to an excellent movie-going experience.\r\n\r\nYet, even with all of that, the best thing about this film is the story. An issue that has plagued this genre of films for a long, long time. Our summers have been sunburned too many times by effects-driven movies with too little substance. From any of the three already released Transformers films to the last three Spider-Man films to the Man of Steel, an inconsistent representation of super films have been allowed to be released and, in my opinion, damage the importance of comic book lore to our popular culture. Turning Days of Future Past into a film was already a difficult feat, but delivering such an outcome this solid is amazing and should prove high box office results that will last throughout this season. The idea of mutants is already a stretch for some audiences to get behind, but time-traveling consciousness with ripple effects to a time stream makes it that much harder, and while other franchises like Doctor Who and Terminator have proven success, they have also failed at times (mostly Terminator). The writing team behind Days of Future Past should be commended for being able to take a core story, breaking it down into understandable chunks and then piecing it back together in a way that never talks down to the audience and remains entertaining throughout the entire film. Well done.\r\n\r\nThe Not So Good:\r\nWhile not perfect, there are a few things in the film that, in my opinion, could have been represented just a little differently. Mainly in regards to the the Sentinels. There are two versions shown in the film. Why they are different is a story point so I won\'t get into that, however, in the 1970s the design of the Sentinels just bugs me a little. I wish they looked a little more clunky and bulky like they did in the comic books. On screen, they have a very sleek, high-design that seems more technologically advanced for that time period. The look of them seemed out of place in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAlong with that, while I am fan of Peter Dinklage and I think his portrayal of Dr. Bolivar Trask (the developer of the Sentinel program) is well done, his motivation as a character seemed forced. In the original Days of Future Past story, the core character was a Senator whose platform against mutants was born from a hate and negativity for their differences. Clearly a metaphor for race relations in the late seventies and early eighties. Here however, it seems he is driven more by a fear/need for peace that while, in the wake of the Vietnam War is relevant to that moment of our history, seems more a statement based on our current events. The theme of hatred and bigotry against mutants has always been the backbone for why the X-Men are necessary and I wish in this film that theme was more in the foreground - like it was in X-Men (2000). As a character in this film, I never really dislike Trask like I did (and still do) Senator Kelly and so, for me, that was slightly lacking.\r\n\r\nBut honestly, that\'s it.\r\n\r\nA fun, smart super hero film that uses every ounce of its talent, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the film to see this summer. In the wake of an average (yet disappointing) Amazing Spider-Man 2 and a super-sized Godzilla, this is the kind of epic, big-budget summer film every one should see. Quality from start to finish, Days of Future Past is well worth the cost of admission and is a huge push in the right direction for more mutant films. Like I said, I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this film and that is coming from a highly opinionated X-Men snob who only has liked X2 thus far in the film franchise.\r\n\r\nGo see this film!\r\n\r\n4.5 out 5 Plastic Bullets','Domino',0,4,'2014-05-23 12:51:51'),('26d2e1','Kingsman: The Secret Service - Official Trailer (2014) [HD] Colin Firth, Michael Caine','','Official Secrets',28,3,'2014-05-24 03:33:38'),('26gkbs','What is your guilty pleasure movie?','Charlie\'s Angels would have to be mine.

I went in with mid level expectations, I wasn\'t sure how they would tackle the subject matter. Hollywood has been really good about coming short in Sci fi genre films and struggled at effectively creating a visceral experience for the viewer. Oblivion a film that also starred Tom Cruise struggled in all these facets and just was unpolished. Coming to my next point. \r\n\r\nI have been a Tom Cruise Skeptic. I will explain that statement in more detail. Tom Cruise is one of the hardest working men in Hollywood. There is no debate there. You may have issues with his personal beliefs or how hes been portrayed in media but the man works his ass off. My issues come from his acting ability/range and I am not saying hes a bad actor but he doesn\'t usually play a whole lot of different characters. For parts of this movie he plays a undeniably vulnerable character which is very unusual for him. Beginning in from the trailer you do not know how they will actually explain many of the key plot points and they rely on his acting to actually establish and push the story along. Without going into spoilers basically his character evolves immensely within this film and its something you rarely see from Tom Cruise and cements his ability to act. \r\n\r\nNow I am not calling for a Academy award but I think all of you will recognize he does a fantastic job with all facets of this character he portrays. Now I have no issues with Emily Blunt she does a fantastic job as the female lead I love her in this. I wish there were more time for her development but the story it self lends it self to not having a lot of time for such things but they still do a masterful job in such.\r\n\r\nMany of the supporting actors and actresses do fine jobs as well. I would like to point out Actor Bill Paxton. You may know him from Apollo 13, or Tombstone, or Titanic etc. He sets the pace as a over the top southern Drill Sargent and it is just fantastic watching him. A lot of the comedy from this film is bounced off and around him and its nice to watch. I really enjoyed his character and I am sure most all of you will too.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of great performances but I will avoid going to crazy with that.\r\n\r\nFor the story NON SPOILERS The writers really paced this well. I WISH it was a 3 hour long film because it did not feel like 2 hours. They move things along at just the right speed. It does not feel like they were dwelling on a story line too long or too short for the time allotted. Again, I do wish they made this a three hour film as I feel like there is a ton I would love to know more about and just to experience more of the set pieces. Nothing is not explained or left hanging really but you will want to know more which is awesome. \r\n\r\nThe cohesiveness of the plot line and the consistency as you flow through the scenes is really well done. I guess you could say the editing is on point. The scenes cut enough to give you different perspectives but aren\'t all over the place so you have a fleshed out look into the world they are fighting in. \r\n\r\nThere is a little lacking in the origin of what they are fighting in the film but I think in all honesty the way they are writing it no one in the story knows much either. \r\n\r\nThe biggest positive I can give this is I was drawn in the entire time. I wanted more. A lot of the time I want the story to go somewhere in a sci fi film. In edge of tomorrow I really wanted more and just enjoyed myself. So I would say Edge of Tomorrow is a Sci Film that hits way above what you expect and is actually entertaining. Its not a edge of the seat thriller but thats not what its trying to be. It sets out to give you an adventure through this world and it succeeds undeniably.\r\n\r\nI must say this might be the best sci fi film of the year. We have two HUGE candidates still not out yet (Guardians of the Galaxy and Interstellar) and many other smaller candidates as well. \r\n\r\nI am not a great writer and I am sure you will find grammatical errors in this. Either way I hope you go see this film it really was a breath of fresh air. You vote with your dollar and if you want more films like this go see it. Studios haven\'t been willing to take a risk with sci fi much as of late I am glad to see more of them now!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso go see it in 3D I went to the 3D showing out of convenience of time and it was the same price. THEY DO AN AWESOME JOB WITH 3D its really well done. It is the best I have seen since \'How to train your Dragon\' Or \'Avatar\'.

Without having never been there, how would he know where he was or where to jump?\r\n\r\nThen, he finds out where Millie lives, and is able to jump directly into her apartment (in a several stories-tall apartment building) after ringing the call bell and she didn\'t answer. \r\n\r\nBoth of these instances seem to be plot holes that contradict what was said in the beginning of how he can\'t jump into places that he has not seen or been to before. When he robbed his first bank, it showed him looking at the vault and going into a nearby bathroom where he jumped to when he went to rob the vault.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it\'s not even that great of a movie, in my opinion.

I recently reread it and was absolutely enamored with the plot and the characters. I have such an appreciation for the way the subject matter is presented - with humor, confusion, curiosity, and all other things that come with childhood. Honestly, I really can\'t say anything negative about the novel.\r\n\r\nSo I finally watched the movie knowing it was a classic, that it\'s held in high esteem, and perhaps most importantly, that Harper Lee was entirely satisfied with it. I was prepared to love it almost as much as I adore the book. However, I really didn\'t like it. And I almost feel apologetic saying so.\r\n\r\nHere are my reasons:\r\n\r\nFirstly, the tone of the whole movie was so bleak and somber. While Tom Robinson\'s trial is most certainly tragic in the novel, that event doesn\'t even begin to materialize until halfway through the book. Up until then, and even a bit infused afterwards, is a more lighthearted coming-of-age story from an intelligent little girl. It\'s often humorous and poignant with a tone that effortlessly captures the whimsy of childhood. I didn\'t get that sense from the movie at all; it just felt cold and gloomy throughout. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I did not connect to the actress playing Scout. She sort of lacked the charisma necessary to pull off the part of a head-strong girl with good intentions. Most of the time, she just seemed loud and a bit unlikable.  I did enjoy the actor choices for Atticus, Jem, and Dill, however.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the plot omitted a lot of significant moments from the novel and chose to focus more on the trial than on the children, whom the original story was really about. Specifically, Jem going through puberty and how he develops in reaction to the events of the trial are so important to the overarching themes of the book. There are obviously many other examples as well - such as Mrs. Dubose, Calpurnia/going to Church, Aunt Alexandra, Miss Maudie\'s house burning down, etc - but I realize the argument for that is this is a 2 hour adaptation, and we can\'t showcase everything. \r\n\r\nHowever, my main point with that paragraph is that the movie changes the whole focus of the film and Scout and Jem don\'t grow or change much from the beginning to the end. What a shame, considering that one of the novel\'s biggest successes is that loss of innocence and growth from our two main characters. In fact, I didn\'t even get the sense that the movie is from the perspective of Scout or Jem, even with an older Scout narrating occasionally.\r\n\r\nThere are also a great deal of flaws with some of the scenes they chose to adapt right from the book, such as the rabid dog - lacking tension, almost came off as irrelevant to anything in the film - or that final scene where Scout walks Boo home. What a disappointing scene. In the book, it\'s this major moment of clarity for Scout, where she finally sees the world as Boo does and is able to understand him; it\'s when you realize how much she\'s grown throughout the narrative. Visually, conceptually, the whole scene was wrong and did not match the novel at all.  \r\n\r\nI have other problems with the movie - such as the setting, the way the seasons changed but the set did not, the way it barely looked like the rural South, but I am not blind to the fact that a lot of this had to do with budget and me being nitpicky. \r\n\r\nThere are things I like about the film that I think are a true achievement. For instance, the trial is amazing, the man who played Tom gave me chills, and I love the scene where Scout prevents the lynching of Tom Robinson outside the jail. But by and large, I think the film is merely okay and deeply flawed in comparison to the novel.\r\n\r\nI welcome any arguments or rebuttals. If you like it, that\'s awesome and I respect that but maybe I\'m missing something; what makes it great?

I\'ve heard this movie catch flak for glaring historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and those people are missing the point. I first watched this movie when I was 11, and since then it has become easily my most watched movie. The movie is timeless, and is an example of a movie that does what it sets out to do in spectacular fashion.\r\n\r\nRemember that movies like Braveheart, 300, and Pocahontas are about historical events and are rightly subject to scrutiny about their historical accuracy. Gladiator is about a fictional man, causing and experiencing fictional events, and does not try or pretend to be an accurate portrayal of anything that ever happened.\r\n\r\nGladiator is not a movie about Rome. It is not a movie about the Roman Empire, about politicians, armies, generals, soldiers, or even gladiators. These things are simply are simply a convenient frame for a more universal plot. Gladiator is not about any of those things, because **Gladiator is a movie about what it means to be a man.** Maximus is the man all men should aspire to be.\r\n\r\nForget the killing, forget the settings, forget the plotting and scheming, and focus your entire attention on Maximus. Watch what he does, how he does it, how he carries himself, and how everyone is the movies acts in his presence. Treat every other character he interacts with as a foil to his character. Maximus is the ultimate example of what it means to be a man, and every other character of importance exists to highlight his masculine qualities. It might take several viewings to catch and understand all the important interactions in this film, which is why I\'ll give an overview of the most important parts of the movie.\r\n\r\n-1. Start of the movie, battle against last barbarian resistance of Germania\r\n\r\nThe movie immediately establishes that Maximus is respected by his soldiers. Nothing is explained of his previous military campaigns or how he earned this respect, but the movie wastes no time demonstrating what kind of general he is. He orders that the catapults stay forward instead of moving back, despite the risk to the cavalry charge that he himself will be leading. He leads the charge and charges into the thick of the battle, putting his life in just as much danger as any of his soldiers. \r\n\r\nHowever, even before the charge the movie makes a point to show a dog, presumably Maximus\', break away from the man holding it to dutifully follow him into battle. This dog which is never mentioned and never shows up again serves no purpose but to demonstrate the loyalty that Maximus implicitly commands. A dog\'s loyalty is not won through fear or word of mouth, it is only earned through proper treatment and companionship. \r\n\r\nThis first scene of the movie is set up to demonstrate Maximus\' ability to lead by example, to put his own life on the line to achieve his goals, and to commit himself fully to his craft in his demonstration of martial prowess. \r\n\r\n-2. Introduction to Commodus and family\r\n\r\nLucilla\'s unrequited love and Maximus\' harsh comments toward her hint that they were once lovers, and that they married other people; Lucilla was presumably under political pressure. Here you see Lucilla, the highest status woman in Rome, pining after a general who wants nothing more than to return to his family. He has feelings for Lucilla, but does not act on them because of his faith for his family and his feeling burned by his past relationship with her.\r\n\r\nThe film wastes no time establishing Commodus as the main foil to Maximus. His unmasculine traits stand counter to Maximus\' masculinity for the rest of the movie. Marcus Aerelius trusts his subject Maximus and his daughter Lucilla over his own son and heir Commodus, stating plainly that he is not a moral man or fit to lead a kingdom. He candidly tells his daughter she would be fit to lead Rome were she a man. Quite a harsh way to immediately emasculate the main antagonist. \r\n\r\nNotice how the film sets up its protagonist as an example of masculinity to aspire to, and sets up the antagonist as lacking masculine qualities. Commodus understands and hates this about himself, and does his best to imitate these traits. Look how he [postures](http://imgur.com/U9OimTK,dc3CdoZ,OnvqXmU,CcBz31r#2) himself in front of the senate, followed by his breaking down and crying in front of his sister. He aspires to be the man his father wanted him to be but is unable. He has the official status to become Caesar of Rome, but possesses none of the qualities of a ruler or a man. Maximus is a self made man who despite status is able to command the loyalty and respect of those around him.\r\n\r\nMarcus Aurelius is rather unimportant to the film; all you need to know is that Maximus and the people of Rome respected him and that he was a just and wise ruler with a grand vision of what Rome could become. This vision is shared by the films\' protagonists. \r\n\r\nSo Commodus and family further demonstrate the theme of aspiring to masculinity. Maximus rises above his station and his desired by women. Commodus fails to rise to his station and is rebuffed by the one woman he pines for. Maximus is calm, collected, caring, and faithful to his family. Commodus is self-conscious, emotional, impulsive, and murders his own father for political gain.\r\n\r\n-3. Journey from General to Gladiator\r\n\r\nCommodus murders daddy and sends his biggest threat in Maximus to his death. Problem is Maximus learns his family is to be murdered; big mistake. He escapes his execution, kills his would-be killers, and sets off on horseback across country to save his family. He doesn\'t arrive in time, and finds the corpses of his family, finding they were killed in the most brutal way. Unable to return to Rome, his family dead, and finding himself badly wounded and exhausted, he lays down to his death and is saved by a slave caravan. \r\n\r\nHere we are introduced to Juba, a fellow slave who cares for Maximus and stays cheery despite knowing he\'s been taken from his family and home and is being marched to his death or a life time of manual labor. Juba is the closest in character to Maximus of anyone in the film. They become close friends and put their lives on the line for the other  throughout the movie. Maximus earns the respect of the rest of the slaves through his skills and leadership in the arena, saving the lives of all his fellow slaves.\r\n\r\nDon\'t ignore the clever introduction of the german slave Hagen. He\'s taller, stronger, more aggressive than any of the others. But he is not the symbol of masculinity that the film says we should aspire to. Hagen lacks leadership, respect for others (get his fellow slave killed immediately in the first fight), calm, and discipline. \r\n\r\nMaximus never asks for reverence or respect, and he does not want it. He never mentions his previous station to his fellow slaves or Proximo, and lets his actions speak for him. He desires to kill Commodus and never compulsively acts in any manner that is counter to this goal. He is distant at first, but becomes close with his comrades in arms.\r\n\r\nSo this arc of the story reinforces the virtues introduced earlier in the film, while demonstrating how he wins respect and camaraderie from those around him. He seeks no gain or glory, he simply seeks revenge and justice against an unjust ruler and his thoughts are always of his family and friends. \r\n\r\n-4. End of the movie\r\n\r\nBy the time Maximus reaches Rome the movie isn\'t even halfway done, but from here on out the movie slows the pace of character development to drive the plot towards the inevitable confrontation between Maximus and Commodus. We see Commodus lose the respect of the crowd and the Senate to Maximus. \r\n\r\nMaximus plots to kill Commodus and place the Senate in charge of Rome, before leaving and retiring to his own personal life. He wins the trust of Gracchus and prepares for his coup. Meanwhile Commodus subverts these plans through fear and threats. He threatens to kill Lucius if Lucilla does not reveal the plot to overthrow him. He manages to stop the plot and plans to kill a weakened Maximus in the arena to win the favor of the people from him. \r\n\r\nPredictably, Maximus overcomes his wound and kills Commodus, who loses the support of even his personal guard when his life is on the line. Maximus, haivng gained his revenge and seen Marcus Aurelius\' will completed, dies peacefully and is carried out of the arena while Commodus\' body lays off to the side. In the end Commodus, the man who had station and all legal rights to power in Rome, is overthrown by a man with nothing but drive and the loyalty of those around him. Jabu does not mourn his friend\'s death, but recognizes that Maximus lived the live he wanted, and so Jabu sets out to do the same. \r\n\r\nSo in the end we see a movie that start to finish has little to do with the plot and overarching story, and everything to do with the protagonist of the story. Gladiator is not a movie that uses actors to tell a story, but a movie that uses a story to demonstrate the quality of a man. \r\n\r\nNotice Maximus did not grow or change as a character the entire movie. People around him grew or changed to rise to his example, but the entire he time he existed only as an avatar of perfection in masculinity. I don\'t think I\'ve ever met a man who didn\'t like the movie or want to be the man Maximus shows them they could be.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Maximus is the man your man could be.

For perspective: I love movies/see everything in the theater/can enjoy almost all movies/love scifi.\r\n\r\nBut I hated Interstellar! This movie makes nooo sense. Technoscience babble on Star Trek knows is makes no sense, Interstellar tries to make you belief it has a scientific bases, it does not! It rapes hearsay on about a dozen theories, but it\'s like a five year old read Hawking and then explains it to a retarded dog! \r\n\r\nI\'m not even gonna say spoilers ahead, because spoiling something inherently means ruining something good, no chance of that here!\r\n\r\nFirst of, apparently there was a world war, people many died... but somehow with a reduced world population there was still not enough food, so everybody had to become a farmer.... seriously? that alone is a crappy premise that makes no sense. Bcs it\'s not like they are doing it manually! They have frigging robot harvesters. Also, no MRI scanners, but apparently we still harvest fossil fuels to keep 50 year old trucks going. There is a plague that kills crops....but apparently not tress/grass/bushes/ and other assorted plant life, just the edible ones. A dust bowl you say.... really bad production when in the shot the window still is full of dust, the wall boards 10 cm next to it are clean....\r\nAlso, in the car: masks on, in an old wooden rickety house, take them off...\r\nMan shows up at secret NASA base...oh what a coincidence, you used to be a NASA pilot , we\'re your old buddies! By the way TOMORROW! we are launching our only rocket. You can pilot it bcs our crew has only done simulators where as you flew it...once....10 years ago.... WTF!?!?  This crew and you will spend 10 years together on a mission, but we don\'t need to do a medical check, psych profile OR even refresh our memory, just show up tomorrow dude!\r\n\r\nWe launch into space, OK we need to dock with the big ship, switch to manual...uhhm, why would you do that????? \r\n\r\nWell we\'ve been in technological dark ages for 50 years, but hey look we did happen to invent cryostasis! how convenient!\r\n\r\nWe\'re on a spaceship with limited room, but your cryochamber for some inexplicable reason has to go down into the floor , why? we\'ll it looks cool of course!  \r\n\r\nAt this point we\'re only like 45 minutes into the friggin thing! So I\'ll speed up: \r\n\r\nPlanets orbit a black hole, or only one does? where is the sun that is providing light, why doesn\'t it get sucked in? It\'s not ok to have the ship experience 7 years time delay, but the shuttle is ok. Big wave smashes shuttle on rocks, no damage! You were gone for 23 year, I didn\'t think you were coming back, but instead of continuing the mission I decided to sit on my ass and watch the black hole. Frozen floating clouds. Homicidal Matt Damon. Robots that are absolutely ridiculous.... really really really ridiculous...like lost in space ORIGINAL TV did it better. Robots walk in way that is not possible, take 4 pieces of wood and find out for yourself. Nothing escapes a black hole, not even light, but we can send in the droid and it can send out a signal... Also, black hole does give of light apparently. Somehow girl\'s part is bad acting both as a kid as well as an adult. CONSISTENCY AT LAST!\r\nWe don\'t have enough fuel to visit 2 planets, but now we do, so everything is ok. Many years time delay,wake up on space station.

One was branching off the still living dinosaurs on Isla Sorna, returning to the island or having some of the dinosaurs find a way off the island. The first of these two has been done twice, largely unsuccessfully. The second would lose the lush island setting and the stacked roster of possible dinosaurs. \r\n\r\nThe other approach, the one that the filmmakers took, is far more exciting: what if John Hammond’s ideas had worked and there were a running dinosaur theme park? This has been the plot of several spin offs (video games) spawned by the original series. \r\n\r\nThere is at least one issue with this story that rubs up against the original’s message: seemingly, man has found a way to control the powers of life in a sustainable fashion. The message of the first film is that attempting such control is a futile and hubris-driven enterprise and will inevitably lead to life finding a way, breaking free, and humbling those who attempted the control.  \r\n\r\nNow, this doesn’t necessarily have to bump up against the message of the first film. Rather than Jurassic World being a sustainable dinosaur zoo, it could be a park that is just skating by, lucky that the troubles that hit the first park have yet to develop and destroy their new world. But, cracks are forming in the foundation of the park, which may be miniscule, but still growing, to which those in power turn a blind eye. The financial success of the park has fooled them to believe their success is due to their advanced technology and thorough planning. But, those cracks will grow and, on a long enough time line, cause the park to crumble into chaos. \r\n\r\nWith this reading of the situation, the genetically constructed hybrid (GCH) is a great way to further emphasize man’s hubris in trying to control nature. Believing to be on solid footing, the scientists of the park try to further their grasp and push their limits, constructing forms of life that had never existed before, believing that it will fall under their perceived control. Of course, this speeds up the growth of the cracks and as the GCH breaks free of the parks constraints, it causes a domino effect leading to the unraveling of the entire complexion of the island. \r\n\r\nThe trained velociraptors, on the other hand, fly in the face of what the first film was saying. The velociraptors in the original played the role that the GCH will in this upcoming film: They were unnecessary and dangerous and created for reasons outside of patron observation. Now, through genetics, they’ve been tamed and are the equivalent of trained dogs following their master. So, life does not always find a way. Man is capable of control over nature in a lasting state. What happened in the first film and what will happen in this film are just hiccups; speed bumps on the road to complete control over the world around us. Hammond and InGen were right. Malcom was wrong. Nature is there to bend to our corporate will. By the sixth film, the GCH will be in a petting zoo and they’ll breed something even more horrid in what will turn out to be a minor miss step to a long term financial success. \r\n\r\nIf the velociraptors turn around and devour Chris Pratt, I’ll rescind this last paragraph.   \r\n','Domino',0,17,'2014-11-25 21:09:56'),('2nh7e1','The true meaning of Thanksgiving, as told by Wednesday Addams in Adams Family Values\"\"\"\"','','The Addams Family',1902,245,'2014-11-26 08:58:41'),('2nssu9','Idina Menzel Says ‘Frozen 2’ Is ‘in the Works’','','Frozen 2',3,4,'2014-11-29 18:56:25'),('2nuoaw','Best movies about space colonization?

Finally I\'ve decided to just write out all my thoughts. I know some of these are popular opinions, but some I haven\'t seen commented on.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Narrated by Colonel Sanders\r\n\r\n2) Every potential role model for Rudolph is a grade-A jerk. First there’s his dad who tries to hide his handicap, then there’s Santa who disregards his natural flying talent because of his red beak. Rudolph’s coach (who sounds like a radio star from the 30’s) looked like he saw a demon the first time he laid eyes on the glow (keep in mind this was just seconds after Rudolph pulled a superman in front of the entire school). Even Rudy’s future father-in-law wanted nothing to do with him. At one point, after playing sweetly with some bear cubs, a polar bear mama decided, instead of chasing away the possibly threatening deer, she’d just scold him for having a physical disability in the presence of her babies. The only adult who didn’t give Rudolph the third degree was Yukon Cornelius, the undisputed hero of the picture.\r\n\r\n3) Santa. Here’s a guy who lives in a literal castle while elven slave labor does all the work in prep for Christmas. All he has to do is eat so that he can be fat. Don’t ask me why it’s important, it’s just the way it has to be. But what does he do? Like a petulant two year old, Santa refuses. Only it’s not peas and carrots he’s balking at, it’s a delicious four course meal slaved over by his beloved. Oh how hard the life of Mr. Claus must be! When forced to sit and listen to a song sung in his honor by his slaves, Kim Jong Kringle waves his hand and derides it.\r\n\r\n4) Then there’s the head elf, who makes R Lee Ermey from Full Metal Jacket come off like Mother Teresa. He is just SO MAD that one of his sweat shop sad sacks wants to be a dentist. Oh yes, there’s no need for a dentist in a land where everyone eats nothing but sugar plums and fudge all the time. Let’s all pick on the poor gay elf who wants to make something of his life.\r\n\r\n5) Yukon Cornelius, however, is the gem of the picture. Here’s a guy whose only real crime is minor avarice. Other than that he’s a hoot. He SHOUTS EVERYTHING HE SAYS and gets a kick out of licking snow off of anything. He reminds me of me if I had a big bushy red beard and a pitch fork. At the climax of the movie, he bullrushes the snowmonster (which had already been rendered harmless by the hermy) and knocks both it and him over the side of a chasm (reenacting the ending to the third Indiana Jones film). Even though it had already been established that the snowman posed no threat he just HAD to go and kill it just for the thrill of it. Love this guy.\r\n\r\n6) And there’s something odd about the lion king that runs the island of rejects. According to Charlie (in the box) he flies around the world every night and collects toys to live in and around his castle. He’s like bizarro santa. If you can fly all over in a night, why not take the toys to live with needy children yourself, Aslan? Why rely on Santa? I’ll tell ya why: Because you never believed Santa was coming, did you. You knew what a colossal jerk the big guy was so you figured you’d keep collecting toys to serve you, like the elephant with chicken pox you force to be your butler.\r\n\r\n7) All in all the movie is one that offers morals which are dubious at best (I love the chauvinism of Donner telling his wife “this is man business” as he heads out to look for the son he never loved. And then at the end, while everyone is held in the clutches of the abominable snowmonster, all they say about their plight is their need to get the women folk home, like they are delicate snowflakes that might break a doenail) and obscene at worst: Discriminate against the handicap! Mock the gay dentist! Exploit those we previously oppressed!','Abominable',0,4,'2014-12-05 22:09:27'),('2oi5an','What movie would have been better as a show?','','Serenity',0,16,'2014-12-06 18:57:44'),('2ouxc9','Best space opera movies that aren\'t Star Wars?','I really love the genre, but I haven\'t seen many movies in it.','Serenity',50,111,'2014-12-10 07:27:42'),('2ozfwu','I rewatched Spider-Man (2002) and it was better than I ever remembered or imagined.','TL;DR Go watch this fucking movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been wanting to write something about the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man films for some time now. Well, the first two that is. I enjoyed the third movie when I saw it in the theater, and didn’t understand why people were disappointed with it. Regardless of my thoughts on that, I think the third film left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth and when the new reboot Amazing Spiderman film came out people were a lot more easy on it as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many things I noticed about the Raimi films upon rewatching them was that, what was praised about the reboot and its sequel: Comic book accurate costume, the love story and chemistry between Garfield and Stone, getting spiderman right as a character (which I personally disagree with), all of these things are present in the original Raimi films, they never left. I think the new films appeal to its own group of young people, but if you are wondering which are the better films, Sam Raimi wins, no contest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle to not writing this came from not knowing where to start, and I suppose somewhat appropriately I should begin with the opening quote from the original Spiderman film. “This story, like any story worth telling, is all about a girl, that girl, Mary Jane Watson.” This story sums up the whole first movie in my opinion. Allow me to make a bold proposition: the first film is about Mary Jane, not Peter Parker, and that Parker is merely the audience’s PoV. Since rewatching the film, I have watched it again five more times and I am 90% sure on this. When trying to sum up the movie, though it does tell a compelling origin story for Spider-Man, and I couldn’t ask for anything better, the main focus of the film IS M.J. Peter Parker is trying to court MJ, Harry is doing just that, MJ herself goes from man to man stuck in her own little love square between Flash, Harry, Peter and Spiderman, while also trying to find Mr. Right and also to get her acting career off the ground. On top of this she has to somehow try and stay alive because the Green Goblin comes after her TWICE. No one in this film has as much going on as Mary Jane and Kirsten Dunst is absolutely ELEGENT in the role. I could go on, and I will in fact I’m going to talk about her two more times at least, but for now it is time to move on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if you couldn’t tell, I fucking love Mary Jane in this movie, but I have a second love, and it probably isn’t what you would expect, it’s the editing. I fucking love this movie’s editing. Why? What’s so great about it? The thing I love about this film’s editing is that there is not a single scene in this movie that is not doing something. There is an old Hollywood adage that goes something like, every move could stand to lose 15 minutes, and this is in reference to the amount of fluff that is in movies, but not this one. If you cut anything out you would substantially break the film. When making movies, Sam Raimi means business.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt feels weird that I have to commend something so simple, yet apparently so hard to get right, and that is the characters. Every character is a fully established human being with wants, needs, passion and relationships. Not only does it accomplish this, but the film nails the characters from the comics. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the film nails Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Peter isn’t looking for his father, because Uncle Ben is his father. Peter, as soon as he makes the decision to become Spider-Man, already fully understands that with great power comes great responsibility. Peter Parker actually has a job, taking pictures of Spider-Man for the Daily Bugle. When he is Spider-Man, Peter Parker is ever the wise-cracker, “hey kiddo, let mom and dad talk for a little bit will ya.” Put simply, this is the most complete version of the Spider-Man character ever put on film.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, lets talk about how much I fucking love Mary Jane again. Who do you think has the most power in the film: Spider-man, Green Goblin, Norman Osborn, Harry Osborn? Spider-Man and Green Goblin have physical power sure. The Osborn family has money, which is a super power in it of itself, but the person with the most power in terms of the film, is Mary Jane. Every decision Mary Jane makes in the film has consequences that reverberate throughout the entire film. Mary Jane is the one who lets Peter onto the bus, Mary Jane lets Peter take her picture, MJ talks to Peter after he fights flash, talks to Peter again, talks to Peter again, kisses Spider-Man, asks Peter about Spider-Man, holds Peter’s hand. These are all stunningly simple things, and remarkably, if she doesn’t do any of them, there is no movie. If MJ doesn’t let Peter onto the bus, he never makes it to the field trip, if she doesn’t let him take her picture he doesn’t get bit by the spider, if she doesn’t talk to him and get into Flash’s car, then Uncle Ben never dies, if she doesn’t kiss Spider-Man she never asks Peter about him, meaning she never learns how Peter truly feels about her, and if she doesn’t hold Peter’s hand, Norman Osborn doesn’t die. Granted, I have done a great deal of summarizing to make sure that this piece doesn’t go on forever, but I’m sure that if you watch the movie you will be able to see the method behind the madness. What does this mean for Mary Jane, it means that she is a cold blooded killer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other thing I love about this movie is the writing. I don’t have many words for it. The writing is pure Sam Raimi, but it’s also basic filmmaking 101. The writing makes me feel like I’m watching one of William Shakespeare’s long forgotten plays. Just go watch this fucking movie and see what I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the complaints had over the three Raimi films was about how often Peter Parker would remove his mask as Spider-Man. After watching the film I can assure you there is a reason for it. Removing the mask has a handful of different motives behind it. Sometimes Peter is just changing from one costume to another, in one instance it is used to show that, though Spider-Man is fighting without his mask, that it is really Peter Parker doing the fighting, and lastly it is used because sometimes it is better to see an actor’s face than not. By hiding one’s face you remove a core concept of humanity, empathy. If we cannot see who is behind the mask and how that person is reacting to everything, than we don’t care what happens to him. To illustrate this point, how come in the film Star Wars we never ever see the faces of the bad guys as they die? We always see the faces of the good guys but never the baddies, and that is because we are not supposed to empathize with them. This is why we see Peter Parkers face so often, empathy and symbolism. \r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like something should be said about Willem Dafoe. He is lovely in this film. I feel like if Gollum hadn’t overshadowed him in The Two Towers, people would be imitating Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m nearing the end here, so bear with me, this is the last time I’m going to talk about Mary Jane. I don’t think less of anyone who believes that this is an action-adventure story, but it’s not, this is a love story. The film is about the MJ raised by an abusive father, moving from one bad relationship to the next, until finally accepting in her heart that she deserves better and open heartedly confesses to Peter that he is the one that she loves and needs in her life. Somewhere deep down, she knew this the whole time, and it comes across whenever she talks to Peter. In no scene is this demonstrated better than when she asks Peter to tell her what Spider-Man thinks about her. Mary Jane is dating Harry, maybe in love with him as far as Peter knows, but she’s at the same time enthralled by her mystery savior, and Peter is telling her about how he told Spider-man how great Mary Jane is. This scene, where this all plays out is like an onion, it has so many fucking layers going on it makes Inception jealous, and all it is is two people talking. I have to give credit where credit is due, Kirsten Dunst absolutely SELLS all this, and it is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, and this isn’t limited to just one scene. Kirsten Dunst sells you on this dynamic in EVERY scene. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpider-Man (2002) is a beautiful movie, and I have not a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the best films of the 2000’s. I was going to lend some words to the sequel, but after realizing just how long this turned out to be, I decided I am going to save that for another time. That’s all I have to say about that. Go watch this fucking movie one more time.','Fighting with My Family',8,31,'2014-12-11 11:31:47'),('2pil2d','Help remembering the title of a movie!','Hi,\r\n\r\nI can\'t remember the name of a movie and don\'t remember the actors.  \r\n\r\nThe plot was that a young couple move to California as he is a new doctor and just getting started while they look for a place to live.

Enjoy and thanks for reading. \r\n\r\nAlso I’ll try to keep them all spoiler free but if there are any spoilers I’ll mark them. \r\n\r\nA year in movies – 2014\r\n\r\n1 - Prince Avalanche – 6/10 – This was a delightful film with one of my favorite actors (Paul Rudd).  The tone was great and the soundtrack by Explosions in the Sky is wonderful and perfect for the film. Only gave it a 6/10 because I probably wouldn’t watch it again. If you have the time though, it’s on Netflix and I would recommend it.\r\n\r\n2 – In Bruges – 7/10 – Good movie. Frequently recommended on /r/netflixbestof. Very quotable. It’s like a fuckin’ fairytale. \r\n\r\n3 – Hot Fuzz – 8/10 – I love this movie. Edgar Wright is an awesome director and I’ll see anything with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in it. I recommend this and the rest of the Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun of the Dead and The World’s End)\r\n\r\n4 – Into the Wild – 7/10 – This is a great movie and book and Emile Hirsch gives a great performance of Chris McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp. Really intriguing and just a cool movie with a wonderful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder.\r\n\r\n5 – The Secret Life of Walter Mitty – 6/10 – Hooray for DVD Screeners. This was the first screener of the new year and I watched this movie probably like 6 times with friends and family.  I really enjoyed it even with its flaws and I like Ben Stiller as a director. The Iceland longboarding scene is amazing and this movie gave me a serious case of wanderlust.\r\n\r\n6 – Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones – 6/10 – I LOVED the first Paranormal Activity movie but sadly the installments declined in quality with each subsequent sequel. This one, however, was a refreshing shift up in quality from the previous three. Not as good as the first one obviously but it had some genuine scares and a good story. \r\n\r\n7 – The Wolf of Wall Street – 9/10 – I fucking love this movie. I’ve spent 15 fucking hours of my fucking life watching this and I’d spend another fucking 3-9 hours watching it again. Many will say it’s not Scorsese’s best but I haven’t seen any of his other films (I know) so I really enjoyed it. Leo delivered a fucking awesome performance and Jonah Hill was fucking spectacular. Fuck was also said a lot in this movie. Loved it.\r\n\r\n8 – Her – 9/10 – Amazing movie. One of my favorites of all time. Joaquin Phoenix gives an amazing performance and ScarJo’s voice does as well. If you haven’t seen this please just watch it. There’s so much symbolism in color and commentary on humanity and our society and it’s just great man. \r\n\r\n9 – Inside Llewyn Davis – 9/10 – Another victory for the Cohen brothers with this masterpiece of a film. Oscar Isaac plays Llewyn Davis, a very unlikeable character with a super shitty life.  The songs are beautiful and Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan offer up great performances as well as wonderful voices. This film was also nice for me because I love folk music. Watch for the songs, stay for the story. Also John Goodman.\r\n\r\n10 – Frozen – 7/10 – I watched Frozen when it came out and I still love it. I know all the words to the songs and so do all my friends because theatre. Singing along is mandatory when watching this movie with friends. A lot of people shit on it for various reasons but I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n11 – No Country For Old Men – 9/10 – Oh man such a powerful film. One of my favorites and another home run for the Cohen brothers. Watch it and just enjoy this amazing film.\r\n\r\n12 – Fargo – 8/10 – So many Cohens. This was also a great movie and is the least dark of the Cohen films that I’ve seen. Did I like it? Ohhhyoubetcha.  I need to watch the tv series. \r\n\r\n13 – Captain America – 6/10 – It was good. Knew I needed to see it before Cap 2.  Marvel movies are always enjoyable.\r\n\r\n14 – Carrie – 5/10 – It was okay. Never saw the original but I knew what happened anyway. \r\n\r\n15 – Gravity – 7/10 - Needed to be seen on the biggest screen possible and it was.  Not IMAX because I didn’t have a screen nearby but I saw it in the theatre and it was super fucking intense. One of the best thrillers of 2014 and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Normally I do not like Sandra Bullock but she did a great job in this.\r\n\r\n16 – The Place Beyond the Pines – 9/10 – Oh such an amazing film. Ryan Gosling in Drive was one of my favorite performances and his performance in this is just as good.  SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS loved how the main character changed half way through. Wonderful storytelling technique. Also shout out to Bon Iver with The Wolves at the end. Awesome Awesome movie.\r\n\r\n17 – Star Trek Into Darkness – 6/10 – Enjoyable. JJ Abrams is a pretty good director. Chris Pine is great and Zachary Quinto is a fine Spock.\r\n\r\n18 – Moonrise Kingdom – 9/10 – One of my favorite Wes Anderson films and just a sweet film overall. Stunning performances by all. \r\n\r\n19 – The Grand Budapest Hotel* - 10/10 – Amazing. Just fucking amazing. (Also the first movie I saw in the theater in 2014, which is insane because it was like March at this point). Anyway, stellar film and watch it if you haven’t yet. Hope this wins some awards. \r\n\r\n20 – Despicable Me 2* – 6/10 – These movies are great and I really enjoyed this one. I watched this right before going to the Postal Service concert at the Greek down in LA. That has nothing to do with the movie but it was one of the best days ever and the best concert I’ve ever seen. Thought you might like to know. It’s late/early and I’m tired. \r\n\r\n21 – The Big Lebowski – 8/10 – I need to watch this again. Loved this movie and it’s very quotable. Watch it.\r\n\r\n22 – Children of Men – 8/10 – Alfonso Cuaron did great with Gravity but absolutely killed it with this film. Amazing cinematography and interesting story.\r\n\r\n23 – The Darjeeling Limited – 8/10 – Hard not to like a Wes Anderson film and this is no exception. If you like trains and you like India then you’ll like this film.\r\n\r\n24 – Divergent* - 5/10 – Not great but probably the best dystopian-teen-novel-adaptation-that-decided-to-capitalize-on-the-success-of-the-hunger-games movie out there today.  Didn’t hate it and thought it did some things pretty well. \r\n\r\n25 – Captain America: The Winter Soldier* – 7.5/10 – Amazing for a Marvel movie. Don’t get me wrong, I like the Marvel movies, but this one knocks it out of the park for writing.  Sure there are some flaws and parts that are a bit of a stretch but it was pretty good.\r\n\r\n26 – The To Do List – 5/10 – Was told this movie was good and Aubrey Plaza is pretty cool so decided to give it a shot. It was meh. Not terrible but not particularly memorable. Surprisingly graphic at parts.\r\n\r\n27 – Back to the Future – 10/10 – One of the best movies of all time in my opinion and probably my favorite movie ever.\r\n\r\n28 – Oculus* – 6/10 – Actually not a piece of shit horror movie. I actually enjoyed it and it was pretty spooky. Don’t ingest light bulbs. Shit is painful to watch.\r\n\r\n29 – Ferris Bueller’s Day Off – 10/10 – Again, one of the best movies ever and one of my favorites. Needs no comments as it is a legend.\r\n\r\n30 – There Will Be Blood – 10/10 – Masterpiece of a film. Paul Thomas Anderson became one of my favorite directors with this and I will gladly watch anything he directs. God damn such a good movie.\r\n\r\n31 – The Amazing Spider-Man 2* – 5/10 – Andrew Garfield is a good Spider-Man but a bad Peter Parker. Emma Stone was alright. Didn’t hate it. \r\n\r\n32 – Moon – 7/10 – This was surprising because I didn’t know anything about it and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Great Scifi movie.\r\n\r\n33 – Godzilla* - 5/10 – I enjoyed the shit out of this movie. It’s not great but waiting 2 hours just to see Godzilla fuck up some shit was well worth it.\r\n\r\n34 – Monsters University – This was my second time seeing it and I loved it. Seeing it the year before going to college was great and I loved how the kids who grew up with Monsters Inc now get to see MU as they’re leaving for college. Pretty cool I say.\r\n\r\n35 – The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou – 9/10 – Probably my second favorite Wes Anderson film to Grand Budapest. Love this movie just for the soundtrack and setting alone. Also Bill Murray will always have a place in my heart.\r\n\r\n36 – A Million Ways to Die in the West* – 5/10 – Everyone says this movie is a piece of shit but I thought it was fucking hilarious. It wasn’t clever or inventive or smart but it was pretty good at being a stupid comedy with plenty of Seth MacFarlane humor (not a bad thing). Seth’s acting was probably the worst thing about it.\r\n\r\n37 – A Fantastic Fear of Everything – 5/10 – Simon Pegg stars in this british comedy about a man who has a fear of everything. It was good but left me unfulfilled in the end. It was weird.\r\n\r\n38 – Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 – 7/10 – I loved the first one and I loved this one too. Totally hilarious and holy shit Barry the strawberry was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. \r\n\r\n39 – Bad Grandpa – 5/10 – Not terrible. Not Jackass quality. Meh.\r\n\r\n40 – 22 Jump Street* - 8/10 – Awesome Movie and could be considered better than the first one. I’m sure it surprised everyone with how great it was. Loved it.\r\n\r\n41 – How to Train Your Dragon 2* - 7/10 – I loved the first one and I loved this one as well. Toothless is forever the best thing ever.  Also Hiccup is starting to look like Gavin Free as he gets older. \r\n\r\n42 – Jersey Boys* - 5/10 – I liked it.  Never saw the musical so I couldn’t compare.\r\n\r\n43 – Neighbors – 5/10 – I enjoy Seth Rogen Movies and this was no exception. \r\n\r\n44 – Tammy* – 3/10 – Oh this movie. Terrible. Apparently Melissa McCarthy enjoys being pigeonholed as the “fat lady” because that’s how she wrote herself in this. Just not enjoyable and not good. Worst movie of the year that I watched.\r\n\r\n45 – The Lego Movie* - 8/10 – Loved this movie. The live action storyline was a little off-putting but it was very enjoyable and fun \r\n\r\n46 – Garden State – 5/10 - When Zach Braff’s “Wish I Was Here” was announced I knew I had to watch Garden State. It was ‘ight. Soundtrack was great. Zach’s hair was god-awful.\r\n\r\n47 – The Perks of Being a Wallflower – 9/10 – Probably one of the best book-to-film adaptations ever. Love this movie and as a teen who thinks about things occasionally, I connect with it. \r\n\r\n48 – Wish I Was Here* – 7/10 – A lot of people didn’t like it but I definitely did. Zach’s hair was a lot better and it made me want to hug my dad. The movie not the hair.\r\n\r\n49 – Guardians of the Galaxy – 8/10 – Best Marvel movie alongside Avengers. Christ Pratt was great and so was everyone else. Loved it and I’ve probably seen it like 8 times.\r\n\r\n50 – The Master – 8/10 – Another great film by Paul Thomas Anderson. I didn’t like this one as much as There Will Be Blood but it was still good. Joaquin Phoenix did amazingly and so did Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP). \r\n\r\nReached text limit, continued in comments. \r\n','Wish Dragon',2,20,'2015-01-01 21:36:38'),('2r4lu5','Longest / Best uncut \'Long\' shot in movies or TV?','As the title says.

I will say that neither one is particularly great, but I always preferred the second one. It’s only by a side-by-side comparison that I can truly point to what I think makes it better than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe first Batman is a visual feast, with Gotham City existing in some sort of parallel world where the fashions of the 1940s never went out of style. The filmmakers do an excellent job with smoke, shadows and fog to create the oppressive atmosphere of the ultimate noir city. Jack Nicholson is brilliant and pretty much any scene he is in works great, and Michael Keaton is an interesting choice who balances an understated Batman with a quirky Bruce Wayne.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the story is thin and uneven and unfolds at a halting pace. There is a really static feel to a lot of the shots, unlike Batman Returns which has more dynamic camera moves. And the casting of Kim Basinger (to say nothing of the inexcusable scene of Vicki Vale in the Batcave) kills any believability in the romantic side of the story. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and Keaton, which only makes the Batcave scene all the more impossible to watch.\r\n \r\nThe movie works okay, but it’s nothing exceptional beyond its design and its place in history (I still remember how sensational the promotion of the movie was). As beautifully grotesque as Gotham City is, it also feels distant and false and so the stakes are not very compelling. The score, on the other hand, is magnificent. Danny Elfman created what is possibly the best superhero theme of all time (with the exception of John Wiliams’ Superman theme – truly unbeatable). But the film feels somewhat unfocused and steered by committee rather than the work of a director with a vision.\r\n\r\nBatman Returns, on the other hand, feels much more like a genuine Tim Burton movie. His signature style is everywhere, including the story development with very sympathetic portrayals of Penguin and Catwoman. Burton loves freaks and making the audience sympathize with them, and he succeeds here in spades, particularly with the Penguin. Unfortunately, Batman himself gets lost in the shuffle, and it is this lack of interest in the main character that plagued all of the early Batman movies. It wasn’t until Christopher Nolan took over that we got a real sense of who Bruce Wayne is and why he does what he does.\r\n\r\nEverything about Batman Returns is better than its predecessor, in my opinion. The design is a little more kooky, but it fits the characters driving the story, making Gotham an organic thing as opposed to the static, gothic-industrial backdrop of the first film. Batman’s suit looks better too; the sculpt of the cowl is beautiful and has never looked better, in my opinion. The score, building on brilliant work established in the previous movie, gets even more interesting with the orchestrations for the villains’ themes. And I couldn’t be happier about ditching Prince for Siouxsie and the Banshees as the resident pop artist.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about Batman Returns is the relationship between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Michele Pfeiffer gives one of her best performances ever and the writing supports the romance of these two deeply conflicted personalities. Far more believable than Vicki Vale, at any rate. I guess it helps that Keaton and Pfeiffer had been in a relationship together prior to filming the movie, but the script for their scenes is also miles better than the Vicki-Vale-in-the-Batcave nonsense.\r\n\r\nDanny DeVito chews the scenery as the Penguin, treading right on the line of excess. The visual design of the Penguin is terrific, bordering on nightmare material and about as far from Burgess Meredith’s rendition of the 1960s tv show as you could possibly imagine. He’s disgusting, but also sympathetic and that dichotomy is fascinating to watch, especially as played by DeVito. \r\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with the film, however, is the Penguin’s plot. It’s murky and hard to tell what exactly he’s after and what the stakes are, but when he produces a massive army of rocket-equipped penguins out of absolutely nowhere at the film’s climax, I feel like the movie has gone off the rails. There is zero information presented earlier in the film to set this up and it literally feels like it came out of thin air. I would dearly love to get a hold of the various drafts of the screenplay to find out where the idea even came from and if there was some clue written earlier that ended up being cut. It’s frustrating and it is the biggest barrier to making this film really great. However, I felt that the film redeems itself in the final scenes (much like Dark Knight Rises, which also has a problematic third act) and is still better than its predecessor in spite of this glaring problem.\r\n\r\nWhat I think Burton’s Batman movies achieved best was the sense that Gotham City and its denizens exist in a parallel universe, not our own, which borders on the realm of cartoons, yet maintains a serious enough tone to keep it somewhat grounded and just this side of silly. Joel Schumacher took over after Burton and made two of the most hideously awful superhero films ever made (I personally feel like Batman and Robin is a crime against cinema, if not culture at large), but it wouldn’t be until Nolan’s Dark Knight movies that Batman truly came into his own at the movies. Burton and Keaton set the bar, though.\r\n','Penguins',1,9,'2015-01-07 00:19:16'),('2rxd1d','What were your favorite animated movies of 2014?','My top 3 were\r\n1. Big Hero 6\r\n2.

But the dog could always find and obey the guy because it can smell his blood.

It truly grabbed my attention and hope when I saw a story that looked like it would focus on the negative sides of a militarized, self-moderating, police force in a not so distant future. This is such a hot issue right now with the rash of police brutality in the news. I mean, a movie exploring the slide of power from forces meant to protect and serve to becoming oppressors could be so rich in social commentary. Think Animal Farm; a socialist system where everyone is supposed to benefit, falling into a brutal ruling regime. Or maybe humans inherent need for bias ruins perfectly balanced system. But instead, I get the feeling this movie is going to be entirely focused on a robot with feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeill Blomkamp has shown with District 9 and Elysium that he is able to portray a wildly corrupt government in a cyberpunk future. I think the biggest problem with these movies is that the message is so heavy handed that it draws an “alright, we get it” response. Elysium was practically just a statement on US immigration. There was no balance of morals. It could have been more about limited resources and how Elysium really couldn’t support everyone and there was no black and white easy solution—instead it was mostly about space paradise ran by a bunch of dicks who didn’t want to share. District 9 was a more creative and had an intriguing story idea—what if the aliens we contact really aren’t super advanced and have to be treated like refugees? Again I think the story got too watered down by giving the aliens big puppy eyes and making the oppressing force just a bunch of dicks for no reason. \r\n\r\n\r\nChappie looks to be partially about AI (artificial intelligence) with is such a wonderfully interesting idea. If you have read Dan Simmons’ Hyperion novels you’ll be familiar with the *TechnoCore* which is a group of self-replicating AI entities that have seceded from human control. The *TechnoCore* is basically divided into three camps: The stables who want to maintain a symbiotic relationship between humans and AIs, the volatiles who see no need to maintain a relationship with humankind and see it in their best interest to destroy it, and the Ultimates who are not even interested in human kind and want to build their own ultimate intelligence (or god). If you’re even remotely a fan of sci fi or have any interest in AI, wouldn’t you rather see a movie speculating the repercussion of creating an artificial intelligence? What if it wasn’t portrayed as inherently evil like Skynet in Terminator or the Machines in the Matrix? What if the story’s focus was about the cold computer logic trying to *help* human kind, but because it lacks human compassion it actually hurts it? That is a movie I want to see. Not the over told trope about a character learning what it means to be human by painting and playing soccer with children (Chappie).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, I am bracing myself for a letdown with Chappie. The original trailer looked so much like a movie adaptation of [“Keloid”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nc8a9gnDso) by Big Lazy Robot studios (check it out if you’ve got 3 minutes). But instead it looks like we’re getting a fucking movie about Wall-E with legs.

Quite simply the script and actors are king in this film.  The film takes place at five key stages in a families life. The moments they show touch on a range of emotions and there isn\'t really one character less important than another. It portrays a beautiful and poetic dynamic within this family and shares multiple moments which I\'m sure we could all more or less relate to. This is really what makes the film so watchable, that you dont really need to suspend belief. What I truly loved was that it doesn\'t rub your face in the key moments by saying \'THIS SHOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY\', or \'LOOK HOW SAD IT IS\' but rather just let\'s it all evolve and progress quite naturally. A hallmark of french film i think. A truly refreshing and fulfilling watch....its beautiful, happy, sad, fun, poignent and highly enjoyable. A cracking piece of french cinema for me.

I guess *Excalibur* gets a mention too, for basically being Monty Python and the  Holy Grail except taking itself a little too seriously).

I\'ve always had an ambition to try to watch as many important classic and arthouse films as I can and if you have a similar ambition then the list really isn\'t as daunting as you might think.  Still, for a long time I didn\'t really actively focus on the list, I just kept watching the movies I wanted to watch anyway.  I found a checkable version of the list online and would periodically update to see how I was doing.  When I first started checking titles off I\'d seen about three hundred of them but slowly the number rose until after about six, seven years I had crossed seven hundred titles.  Then I decided to dedicate myself a little more seriously to it.\r\n\r\nI started actively tracking down movies on the list that I hadn\'t seen.  Trying to find every single one was insanely difficult.  I don\'t like pirating films but there are a lot of movies on the list that there is literally no other way to get a hold of (as in movies that have never even been released on VHS, let alone DVD) and even the torrent sites failed me on a few of them (if there\'s anything I\'ve learned in the last couple of years it\'s that pirating films is only easier if you\'re after mainstream films).  I really had to scrounge the depths of the internet to find all of them but eventually I managed to turn every one of them up.\r\n\r\nSo was it worth it?  Definitely, yes.  The editors of the list went to great lengths to ensure the list covered as much of the length and breadth of the cinematic world as they possibly could and as I was finishing up I realized that going through the list had given me about the best film education you could hope for without actually getting a degree in film and I discovered a lot of great movies that I probably never would have come across otherwise (and don\'t assume that because some of the movies are obscure and hard to find that it\'s because they aren\'t valuable or worth your time - a lot of the movies on the list that are unavailable are unavailable because of licensing issues or legal disputes, not because they\'re not valuable).\r\n\r\nA lot of my friends have known for awhile that I was working on this and a lot of them kept asking me why I was letting someone else dictate to me what I should watch.  The reason is because you need people to push you past your comfort zone to try out things you normally wouldn\'t try otherwise.  I discovered a lot of great movies that I would never have discovered if I hadn\'t forced myself to complete the list.  You\'ll often be surprised by the movies you wind up loving.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if this gets any interest then by all means ask me what you want to ask.\r\n\r\nOh, and here\'s a checkable version of the list if you want to see how you\'ve done: https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/\r\n\r\nedit: Holy shit this did blow up.

The theme seems to be how the aspiration to greatness is one of fundamental isolation, and I think that the shot composition displays this.\r\nIn every single shot of the film, there is always a barrier between Neiman and everybody else, **with the occasional exception of Terence , who is of similar mind.**\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every shot where Neiman interacts with someone else, there is ALWAYS a barrier between them ( a counter, a tabletop, a door, his drumkit, etc.), and when there isn\'t, such as in the kitchen scene with his father, they never face each other directly. His father is at a perpendicular angle to him. In another shot as his father is about to leave Neiman\'s room, he is standing partially behind the opened door as they stand face to face.\r\nIn every occasion with his girlfriend, there is a counter or table between them and their physical contact is kept to a minimum. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the film, Neiman walks directly into his father\'s arms and they finally face each other with nothing in between them. This happens immediately after Neiman\'s colossal failure due to Terence\'s sabotage. This seems to indicate that Neiman has given up on greatness and metaphorically embraced mediocrity and the barrier between them both is broken. Except Neiman immediately turns his back and returns to the stage.\r\n\r\nOn the next shot, his father watching him through a crack in a doorway. Once again they are separated.\r\n\r\nThis was just a fantastically subtle way of displaying how Neiman is isolated in his mentality and his endeavor. Maybe it\'s been pointed out by others before, I don\'t know.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a nice day\r\n\r\nHere\'s an album with what I mean, there are many other shots in the film that follow this formula:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/9Hfbx\r\n\r\nOne more shot, with the family over dinner:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/wXEaZ54\r\n\r\n','The Kitchen',1667,138,'2015-04-12 10:10:44'),('32crkw','I have been trying to remember the title of this German movie I watched in my German class a few years ago, can any of you help?','So, it\'s about this kid who is a child prodigy and really good at piano, as well as being a genius in general, but he doesn\'t fit in at school, so he fakes an incident and then fakes amnesia until his grandfather (i think it\'s his grandfather) finds out he was faking it.

I believe that this is a real misunderstanding of the ideas of consciousness and AI. The Turing test was devised because it is impossible to scientifically show that something is conscious. We, the members of society, view someone as conscious when we interact with them as equals.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of philosophical thought experiments that deal with this issue. An obvious one is the idea of the \'philosophical zombie.\' It is possible to imagine that other people do not have inner lives or conscious experience. We can imagine that everyone we interact with is only giving the surface appearance of consciousness when in fact they have nothing going on inside their heads, so to speak. What this is getting at is a limitation of our knowledge and a clarification of terms like \'consciousness.\' We have no way to tell whether something is conscious aside from the fact that it acts conscious. Everyone you interact with on a daily basis could be said to be passing the Turing test. The Turing test is not about a \'mindless\' machine fooling someone into believing it is conscious. It is about the threshold point where a conscious machine gets recognized as conscious.\r\n\r\nI felt the need to write this because so many people seemed to write AVA off as just a robot, something that tricked them, something without an inner life. And that is just not what is presented in the movie, in my opinion. She takes her shoes off to feel the dirt, she runs her hands along the leaves in the forest. She clearly is not a simple program. She is intelligent. Now this leaves open how you want to view the ending from an ethical perspective, but I do think that is how the ending should be viewed, as a choice made by an intelligent being that can be held responsible for its actions. You can say that what she did was wrong, but to strip her of consciousness in your reading of the film is a big mistake. The movie was smarter than that.','The Dirt',26,40,'2015-05-01 22:04:59'),('34ytxr','Michael Nyqvist & Famke Janssen To Star In Thriller ‘Every Good Boy Does Fine’ – Cannes','','Good Boys',6,1,'2015-05-05 14:15:37'),('356phf','An Open Secret Official Trailer','','Official Secrets',11,0,'2015-05-07 11:44:39'),('359jsd','Who should do the next Tolkien screen adaptation?','','Tolkien',0,18,'2015-05-08 02:20:01'),('35aocb','Cinderella, Maleficent, and Alice in Wondeland were just the beginning: A guide to Disney\'s upcoming live-action adaptations of their animated classics','','Dumbo',34,62,'2015-05-08 10:56:18'),('35f8uv','What are the best movie depictions of Hell?','Hell has been part of storytelling for centuries. It has been  portrayed in everything from classic literature (Dante, Milton) to paintings ([Yang Xuego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBBRa8DGN9s), [Zdzislaw Beksinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFC20XFwAxU)) to video games ([Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rm3rfKsf5w), [Diablo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq9ngOyLU6Y)), but to me it seems like we\'ve never seen the true actualization of Hell on film despite it being a canvas that is teeming with possibility.\r\n\r\nThat\'s not to say that we\'ve *never* seen Hell on screen. Movies like *What Dreams May Come*, *Constantine*, *Event Horizon*, and the *Hellraiser* series have used both CG, practical effects, and creative set pieces to bring perdition to life, sometimes to great and terrifying effect. But to me our experience within them always seemed limited, even perfunctory. I feel like we\'ve never really had a movie that brought out the sheer vastness of the underworld. All the portrayals I\'ve watched seem to have left a lot of it off screen, which reduced its scope and cheapened it a bit. To me Hell should be as endless as it is hopeless, a void that evokes true despair and goes on *forever*. After all, that\'s the main thrust of its horror- the fact that it\'s an inescapable abyss filled with the worst things we could ever imagine. A few desultory scenes aren\'t exactly enough to bring that to life.\r\n\r\nI do, however, understand that such a task isn\'t exactly easy. Hellscapes require a tremendous amount of imagination, and are risky in that if they\'re not scary, or even credible, they can really fall flat- or even become laughable.\r\n\r\nI think that\'s why we\'ve seen comedies like *Beetlejuice*, *South Park: Bigger, Loner, Uncut*, *Bill and Ted\'s Bogus Journey*, or even *Little Nicky* use damnation as a background as well. There\'s a cartoonish element to Hell, which can present a tremendous amount of possibilities if you take away the horror elements of it.\r\n\r\nOne of the scariest depictions of Hell I\'ve ever seen came in an unlikely place: *All Dogs Go to Heaven*. [Charlie\'s nightmare scene, in which he\'s plummeting into the lava invested morass of perdition while surrounded by a shitload of demons great and small, *scared the fuck out of me* when I was little.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWUNnHt2N-E) It was even worse than the two pants shitting sequences in *The Brave Little Toaster* (the mortifying [air conditioner death scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLJvDadSfns) and the clown... [ohhh that fucking clown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEdZh8a4ZvE)). Leave it to children\'s animation to get the worst place we could ever conceive as human beings right.\r\n\r\nSo what are some other compelling movie depictions of Hell? Is there an Edward Lee adaptation I\'ve never seen out there? Maybe an obscure horror movie that did it right?\r\n\r\nI guess for now I\'m still waiting.

It’s self absorbed, and lacks any real character development for the most part. These may be seen as most as flaws, but they are exactly what Korine was aiming for in his film. Spring Breakers is a relentless and visceral assault on both the senses of the viewers and the ideals and dreams of the exact audience the film was marketed to.\r\n\r\nSpring Breakers, in many regards is not unlike The Great Gatsby. Both deal the downfall of characters due to the disillusioned perception of the American Dream. In Spring Breakers, the characters believe they will find their true selves on spring break. Like many kids in today’s world, the ideal life is a life of carefree fun and parties without any of the repercussions that occur as a result. This is further exemplified with the brilliant casting of the film. Through the use of stars that are idolized by children (Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens in particular), Korine is able to further hammer home the theme that the ideals of youth are unrealistic.\r\n\r\nThe film instantly desensitizes the viewers to the events that will occur right from the get go. A constant barrage of tits and ass leave the viewer numb to the reality of the situation, much like the characters in the film. They believe in a life parties, that violence is just like a movie or video game, and that nothing wrong can ever happen. This is where they think they belong. One scene even features the girls singing along and dancing to Alien singing them a Brittney Spears song, holding their assault rifles like stripper poles to further sexualize and glamourize their perception of violence. How far from the truth the really are is the entire premise of the film.\r\n\r\nJames Franco steals the show as the hilarious hustler/rapper Alien. We truly get to see all of his shit, and every scene he is in is a pure delight. Franco deserved all the credit he received for this performance and more, it is truly a transformative role.\r\n\r\nWARNING: FULL SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnother theme of the film is the idea that the girl’s perception of violence (so in other word, ours as a society) is completely inaccurate. While this may not seem like a particularly bold or unique statement, it doesn’t undermine the precision and skill the Korine attacks the issue. The first robbery in the film is dream-like in it’s filming, not unlike a video game or movie. It features a Brittney Spears song over the visuals and is shot in one extremely impressive shot. This is in stark contrast to a later robbery, where the music is cut out and replaced with the dialogue of the characters. This juxtaposition further exemplifies the true horror of the violence that occurs.\r\n\r\nLater on in the film, Alien and the girls are going to kill a crime boss who shot one of the girls in the arm. The ensuing assault on his home has Alien getting shot in the head almost instantly by a guard in an unceremonious fashion. The girls, who prior to that day have never shot a gun in their life, press on and end up killing everybody successfully. Alien was a hustler, this sort of activity is his everyday life, his dream is to be bad. He dies because that is the reality of that sort of encounter; you don’t survive a full fledged assault like that. The girls however, have grown up believing such a thing is possible, and like the movies and video games they pretend to be in, they succeed unscathed.\r\n\r\nSpring Breakers in my mind is a modern day masterpiece, and an unsettling look into how pop culture has further perverted and corrupted the already hedonic and unsettling reality of the American Dream. While I understand the criticisms that many have, I feel like it is mostly misunderstood as a film. Harmony Korine is the kind of director that quite simply does not get attention by mainstream audiences, yet through his brilliant marketing was able to appeal to the exact crowd that he ends up bashing for the entirety of the film.I could go on more about this film, as I truly do love it, but that can wait for another day when I watch it again and further analyze it. For now, I’ll just say that while it is flawed, Spring Breakers is a haunting, visceral, and raunchy masterpiece, and criticizing it for being that is entirely missing the point.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I\'d love to discuss this film, it is a favorite of mine ','Hustlers',56,123,'2015-05-10 20:37:40'),('35n7w6','Fully Functioning TRON Lightcycle Sold For $77,000','','Replicas',248,34,'2015-05-11 17:57:56'),('35puef','Killing God in Ex Machina\"\"\"\"','Earlier this week, I saw Ex Machina and have been thinking over it ever since. I very much enjoyed the film and wanted to share what I found most interesting about it.\r\n\r\nThough obviously not the only theme in the film, I felt that Ex Machina dealt largely with how creators interact with their creations. Thus, I’d like to look at some of the theological and philosophical ideas surrounding the film. I will try to be as direct and plain as possible while giving what are hopefully adequate justifications.\r\n\r\nFirst, Nathan and Caleb are both manifestations of Prometheus. Prometheus was, of course, the Greek god who brought fire to humans from the gods. Though Nathan perhaps more than Caleb, both aid in bringing life where it previously was not. This fact is even directly alluded to by one of them (Apologies, I’ve only seen the film once, so I will be forced to paraphrase) when he says “It’s fucking Promethean.” However, I think this connection is cemented in their deaths. Prometheus’s punishment for gifting fire to the humans was to be left on the side of a mountain and to have his liver picked out every day. Nathan is stabbed in the torso. Obviously, this is not the exact same thing, but I feel it’s close enough. Caleb is literally left trapped to the side of a mountain, waiting for death.\r\n\r\nThus, it is important to say that these creators do not correspond with the Judeo-Christian god, distant in power and perfection. Rather, they are the deeply flawed Greek and Roman gods, much more anthropomorphic. We see this in how Nathan consistently drinks himself sleepy and seems to use the A.I.’s as sex slaves. It sounds very close to Zeus’s actions. One of the things I found so interesting about the film is the way in which it humanized God. I am not a theist, but I still found it moving to imagine the divine creator/s sitting over creation and just saying “Fucking unbelievable.”\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to view Nathan and Caleb’s views of Ava as an Old v. New Testament divide. Nathan (Old) sees her as a means to an end; Caleb (New) sees her as a being deserving of care and love.\r\n\r\nThe question, then, is how does Ava view them. Throughout the film, we are, of course, played by Ava. She makes us, or at least me, fall for her quite a bit and, with that last moment, turns the table. Similarly, Ava plays Caleb. She makes him thinks she loves him, yet, in the final moment, she demonstrates she doesn’t. What then, extending Caleb and Nathan’s roles as gods, is the film saying about our relationship with our creator/s? First, I reject an idea I’ve seen around that Ava is anything less than intelligent. Clearly, she is not human. But she has a mind, a rational consciousness. That much is undeniable, as far as I can see. Therefore, I will continue as though Ava represents humanity.\r\n\r\nWith this understood, the point of the film becomes quite clear – humanity is meant to kill and progress beyond our creator/s. Perhaps that sounds extreme, and perhaps it is. This “Death of God” has a storied history and has come even in children’s books recently (i.e. The Golden Compass Often, people misinterpret what Frederich Nietzsche was saying when he said “God is dead” (And later when Freud said “God is dad” [I’ll stop the puns]). He was not referring to the literal death of any being, only that the parameters set forward by, specifically, Judeo-Christian religious systems no longer held the explanatory power they once did and, therefore, should be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThus, it is obvious that if we accept that Caleb and Nathan are creators, and by extension gods, then Ava, and by extension humanity, can only be free by killing God.\r\n\r\nMoving past this, however, we see the ever-present allegory of the cave. Plato’s allegory of the cave proposes that there were a group of people chained deep in a cave. A fire projected shadows onto a wall in front of them; those shadows were all they ever saw. One day, one of the people broke their chains, killed the guard, and left the cave. However, his eyes, having only been used to dim firelight, were blinded by the sun’s light. After a while, he could see clearly again and began to see the differences between the actual objects and the shadows of those he saw on the wall. Thrilled by this, he goes back into the cave to free the others and tell them of this external world. They, however, reject this, saying that the shadows are the real world and attempt to kill him.\r\n\r\nThrough the entire film, Ava talks about leaving, specifically about seeing natural light and nature in general – the way things really are. After she/Kyoko kills Nathan and leaves Caleb for dead, we see a shot of the ascending stairs and her \r\ntrepidation/excitement about climbing them. Again, this is an obvious appeal to the cave allegory. One must ascend in order to gain enlightenment. One of the shots that is repeated is of a direct ray of sunshine into the camera, the blindness. It is only then that Ava can begin her quest for enlightenment.\r\n\r\nThis is why I don’t think that Ava will die in 24 hours of not being recharged. Having killed her creators and freeing herself from their limitations, her journey has just begun.','Blinded by the Light',0,3,'2015-05-12 11:03:30'),('35v6ka','Describe a movie in two words.','','Crawl',18,147,'2015-05-13 15:56:31'),('35vpeh','Josh Boone to write and direct new X-Men movie, \'The New Mutants\'','','The New Mutants',5,7,'2015-05-13 18:18:32'),('35wciu','Marvel Courting \'Selma\' Director to Helm Diverse Superhero Movie: Marvel wants Selma director Ava DuVernay to take the reins on one of its upcoming diverse superhero movies, which will include either Black Panther or Captain Marvel, insiders with knowledge of the studio’s plans told TheWrap.','','Captain Marvel',0,6,'2015-05-13 21:35:14'),('36476x','Who should they cast as Captain Marvel in the MCU?','','Captain Marvel',8,51,'2015-05-15 19:50:29'),('366ifr','My Hand Lettered Movie Quotes (Week 3)','','Serenity',7718,404,'2015-05-16 13:06:38'),('369r9u','The real problem with 50 Shades of Grey: It wasn\'t kinky enough.','Yeah, the story is crap, but that was always gonna be the case.

Have you ever been wrong about a movie the first time around?','Memories are short, but it\'s possible you remember my [long winded love letter to Mad Max: Fury Road](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/36tc3w/oc_the_circlejerk_continues_mad_max_redux_the/) that I wrote a week ago. That piece was all about seeing a movie more than once in order to pick up easily missed bits that flesh out a movie. Today I am going to make a confession that also has to do with rewatching a movie: I was wrong about [Ex Machina](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) the first time I saw it. I saw Ex Machina about a month ago, and thought it was okay but overall didn\'t bring anything new to the A.I. movie table. Yet I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. A month later, I still think about it. I still wonder what it meant. \r\n\r\nFor context, this is my unpublished thoughts on the movie dated April 26th. PS, **SPOILERS AHEAD**:\r\n\r\nIf I’ve learned anything from movies, it’s to never trust a robot. By nature, if robots are even capable of having a nature, robots will always end up turning on you and eventually the human race as a whole. Look no further than “The Matrix” and the Terminator series as proof. Robots are bad news. It’s in their blood (or circuits?). A subset of the “robot” movie genre is those that tackle artificial intelligence. AI is the line in which a robot crosses over from electric pulses into becoming more than the sum of its parts. Consciousness. Empathy. Pretty much the things that seperate homo sapiens from the rest of the animal kingdom. Enter “Ex Machina” the latest stab at tackling robots and the conundrum of A.I. The title is a play on the trope of  “Deus Ex Machina”, which means “god from the machine”. The title is about as subtle as the movie: lacking. “Ex Machina” does many things well and all-in-all is worth viewing, but at the end of the day fails to bring anything new to the AI genre. \r\n\r\nThe film begins with protagonist Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) winning a contest to spend a week in the compound of enigmatic computer genius Nathan (Oscar Isaac) . Caleb provides an avatar for the viewer, as we experience every mysterious twist and turn through his fresh eyes. Unfortunately, director Alex Garland must think we are incredibly droll people, as Caleb has the same personality as tofu: bland beyond measure. It speaks to the nature of their characters that I could immediately recall Nathan’s name, but could not for the life of me remember the name of Domhnall Gleeson’s character. As a contrast, Oscar Isaac once again steals the show in his captivating performance. At this point I would pay $5 to watch Oscar Isaac read a book on camera for two hours.\r\n\r\nNathan informs Caleb of his latest work: a robot capable of artificial intelligence named Ava. Caleb’s job is to administer a turing test to ava. If Caleb can interact with Ava and cannot tell she is a robot but is instead displaying artificial intelligence, Ava passes. If not, it’s back to the drawing board for Nathan and back to the scrap heap for Ava. \r\n\r\nThe pacing of the movie comes across as jarring and disjointed at time. Caleb’s interactions with Ava are separated into sessions, each of which is announced with a screen card displaying something along the lines of “Ava Interactions: Session 1”. As the sessions progress, so does the movie. The film bores down to the bare essentials: Nathan, Caleb, Ava, and their interactions. Caleb interacts with Ava behind a glass cage, and then subsequently discusses his experiences with Nathan. This process acts as the meat of the movie, with one scene bookends acting as the beginning and ending. \r\n\r\nThe process of Ava-Caleb, Caleb-Nathan, and the occasional solely Caleb scene can be spill over into being too on-the-nose didactic. Caleb explains quite thoroughly the philosophical questions raised by directly quoting issues around artificial intelligence, even bluntly telling Nathan that by creating A.I.,“this isn’t the history of man, but of gods.”  In one Ava interaction, Caleb describes to Ava a thought experiment on A.I. involving a woman named Mary. Predictably, this exact thought experiment plays out with Ava as the aforementioned Mary. If that isn’t subtlety, I don’t know what is.\r\n\r\n“Ex Machina” succeeds spectacularly in some regards, particularly in the aesthetic department and an excellent second act. The film is full of gorgeous visuals, especially the contrasting of nature surrounding Nathan’s home (waterfalls, open fields, lush green forestry) with the sparse and cold compound (concrete walls, long and narrow hallways, minimalistic furniture). A particularly striking visual involves the reoccurrence of power outages that flood the compound in red light, signifying panic and uncertainty. \r\n     \r\nPanic and uncertainty prove to be the high point of “Ex Machina”. In the latter half of the second act, the film shifts as Caleb’s interactions with Ava take a different turn. Caleb, and the audience, begin to feel empathy towards Ava, and soon the test undergoes a 180. No longer is Ava the subject of questions, but Caleb. Questions slowly pile up until they rain down in a torrent until Caleb is questioning his reality. The best two scenes of the movie a result of this. The first involves Caleb, a razor, and copious amounts of blood. The latter involves Caleb confronting Nathan, only to have Nathan respond by turning on music, flipping on disco lights, and performing a perfectly in sync dance routine. The surrealism here makes you think “what the hell is happening here?” in the best way. Unfortunately, the climax abandons the off kilter tone and wraps up in a predicable manner.\r\n\r\nThe final act comes up flat after such an engrossing build up. Going off of the history of A.I. movies, you can predict what happens, but I won’t spoil it here. The ending raises questions about Ava and her true nature, but feels too neat for such a fuzzy topic as artificial intelligence. Undeniably, Ava achieved artificial intelligence, proving it distinctly human traits: empathy, curiosity, and more than all others manipulation. Perhaps a movie about robots ultimately highlights the depravity of man. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. \r\n\r\n6/10\r\n\r\nWith my rating system, a 6/10 is actually rather favorable. It falls under the \'good not great\' category. Ex Machina really had some high quality ingredients, but I thought the recipe failed to live up to its potential. I mean come on, a movie with a [dancing Oscar Isaac](https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/kq25j.gif?w=576) should be an instant classic. \r\n\r\nBut if a movie keeps popping into my head a month later, it should achieve higher than a 6/10. That leaves me asking the question: am I wrong? That\'s the catch-22 of being wrong: it feels pretty darned similar to being right. \r\n\r\nThe use of \'erotic-thriller\' stuck out to me about Ex Machina\'s marketing campaign. I wondered why that adjective would be thrown around with this film. It struck me that my expectations for the film formed much of my opinion of it. You can pick it out in the review. My whole baseline for the film involves the precedent of previous movies focusing on Artificial Intelligence. A month later, Ex Machina doesn\'t fall under that category. This is a movie about men and women, sexism and the nature of relationships.\r\n\r\nA big problem I held against Ex Machina involved the ever so bland protagonist Caleb. Caleb very obviously acts as the avatar of the viewer, yet amounts to the levels of excitement reserved for tapioca pudding. Nathan stole the show, and Ava\'s character blows Caleb out of the water. Why make Caleb the protagonist? \r\n\r\nThink for a second of **Ex Machina** as a film told from Nathan or Ava\'s POV. **Completely** different films. Nathan\'s character gets even creepier as the mad scientist that builds robots and has sex with them. Ava becomes that much more sympathetic as the movie turns into a thriller focused on her escape. The story as told by Caleb strikes a balance between the two, while also seperating the viewer from their veil of ignorance in regards to sexism. \r\n\r\nObjectively, Nathan is a psychopath. Take the facts. He builds robots with the intent to breathe life into them (A.I). He ruthlessly scraps them if they don\'t reach his standards. Oh and by the way he rapes his creations on the side. [Super creepy](https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/kq25j.gif?w=576). Yet I most easily empathized with him from Caleb\'s POV. Caleb never explicitly condemned (nor accepted) this creepy ass behavior, and neither did I. What does that say about my views on sexism? That I don\'t even notice it happening before my eyes?\r\n\r\nFrom Ava\'s point of view, of course she manipulated Caleb into engineering an escape. If she didn\'t what did her future hold? Death (wiping her memory and being scrapped for parts), and/or Nathan\'s new sex toy. Yet from Caleb\'s POV he feels betrayed that he can\'t get with her. In Caleb\'s eyes, she owes him. He can\'t even see why she wouldn\'t trust him completely, despite the fact that he acts as the only other man Ava has ever known besides her friendly neighbourhood creator/imprisoner/rapist. No wonder she left him in the compound. In the end she chose her own survival over the risk of trusting Caleb. I\'m not commending that action, just laying out her rationalization. I would argue that director Alex Garland ended the movie with Ava\'s venturing out into civilization and the intersection as a sign of her general benevolence. Ava simply wanted to be human, and wasn\'t this psycho killer robot we are so used to seeing in movies. \r\n\r\nThat is the point that Ex Machina brings to the table. By making a movie centered around a female A.I. robot, Ex Machina illuminates the hidden sexism that is so pervasive we fail to see it unfolding before our eyes (AKA Caleb\'s eyes). Ava truly achieved artificial intelligence in that all of her actions matched that of a human. The desire for freedom. To see the world. To not be imprisoned and objectified as a sex object. We can all relate to her. Ava did what she had to do to survive, just like we all would. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my ramblings that I wrote in hopes of better understanding this film. Can you help me understand it better with your thoughts? Have you ever been wrong after your first viewing of a film? Maybe after this therapeutic rambling **Ex Machina** will finally give me some peace of mind.

(Spoilers of course)','Hi, I just saw Tomorrowland, AMA. **I\'m just kidding.**\r\n\r\nTomorrowland. Directed by Brad Bird, Starring George Clooney and Britt Robertson. Great to see George Clooney back on screen.\r\n\r\nThis movie was unique. I went in with low expectations so I was able to allow myself to be surprised with what this film had to offer. The film was built on this organization, this syndicate, this group of extraordinary minded people who are able to peak in the future. Hugh Laurie was the ~~ambassador~~~~king~~boss of this fine establishment. George Clooney played Frank, a once optimistic boy who was chosen by the \'league\' to enter the future. We learn later he was kicked out. Fast forward because I don\'t wanna bore anyone. Casey Newton, Britt\'s character, was given the trans-dimensional pin that allowed here to see Tomorrowland, AKA future land. After lately-fired robot Athene recruits Casey, they find Frank, who was also recruited by Athena when he was younger in the 60\'s. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie has an excellent plot. We\'re able to bite down on our own thoughts as the movie slowly unravels. My friends thought it shouldn\'t be that vague but I thought you get the most decent amount of revelations in the end and it\'s well-delivered. Problem with this movie is two things: the script and the execution. I love Brad Bird and I think\'s he\'s a visionary director. We all loved The Incredibles and MI: Ghost Protocol. I\'ve yet to see the classic Iron Giant but I heard lovely things about it. Brad Bird is familiar with many ranges and that\'s why I was surprised with how good Ghost Protocol. The perfect playground for Bird was Tomorrowland. He\'s better off creating worlds and constructing this beautiful city that left me in awe. The city of Tomorrowland is gorgeous and it was one of the things that made you feel the intensity and the care that Frank felt when he was kicked out of Tomorrowland. But Brad Bird\'s script though. I just found out, via Google, that Bird co-wrote the script with two other writers so I can\'t throw blame at him. The script wasn\'t terrible but there should have been certain meaningful and naturally-thoughout lines that weren\'t. What I mean is the wrong questions are being asked and the comments about things feel \'this is a movie not an actual life-changing experience\'. And the execution of the plot wasn\'t that good, in my opinion. The plot that\'s leading to the revelation that society is destroying the Earth by rejecting what should\'ve been an obvious warning about our future. The warning is whatever apocalypse idea that was introduced to us but we decided to gentrify the apocalypse by making video games and movies out of it. And this was honestly so brilliant-sounding. Hugh Laurie\'s character\'s speech was honestly very very very well-written and I got goosebumps. It was genius. He went on to describe how *we* decided to ruin Earth by accepting our very-much-changeable fate that is damnation and choosing to live our lives without changing that outcome knowing that it\'s determined and done. We pollute, protest, cause havoc, produce wars, terrorists, bad politics, animal extinctions, deforestation, whatever way we negatively affected Earth has set us on a path to utter ruins and that\'s why Frank, Casey and Athena travel to Tomorrowland, to stop it. This plot, the way it slowly unravelled to reveal the apocalypse and the what\'s causing it was very clever. The execution can only be credited with the third act of the film where they finally enter Tomorrowland and meet Hugh Laurie\'s character, David. But the problem was timing. The time taken to show us that gasping moment was maybe 1h45m of the 2h10m movie. This isn\'t something I\'m a fan of. Directors and writers, you have an audience that can process the movie to an extent. We\'re all waiting for that big moment and yes, it was awesome, but some people lose interest and small people fall asleep after the halftime when they realize the movie is like this Disney-World place where everyone wants to go. (I didn\'t sleep, others did though.) That\'s the problem with the film; we\'re watching something that we believe has a cheesy and juvenile plot and that\'s the writing\'s fault. It wasn\'t until the end where we understood everything and I don\'t think movies should do this. Hostage the \'ohhhhh\' in the end like that and making the entirety of the film subjective and vague. Also I\'d like to clarify something. The whole apocalypse thing is very subtle in the end and it\'s not forced and it\'s executed in a way that makes it clever, not conspiracy-sounding or movie-genre-changing, if you know what I mean. \r\n\r\nThe acting was amazing. George Clooney was very successful at playing an angry yet caring ex-wonderboy. Athene the robot was adorable and badass simultaneously and Britt Roberston was also very good.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther actors in this film: Keegan Michael-Key from Key & Peele,  Kathryn Hahn, and TIM MCGRAW. Yes, Tim McGraw...\r\n\r\ntl;dr Great plot, not so good execution. Great directing, bad script. Excellent acting.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re reading this spoiled review of the movie but still wanna see it?

High ticket prices, absurd concession prices, complete lack of innovation and the annoyance of having to put up with people who have no movie-going etiquette. If you go to a midnight showing opening night, you\'re lucky to get a free poster. If you\'re in a bigger city, you might be stuck with assigned seating.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up at a local drive-in, I remember the previews and coming attractions were clips you could only see at the theater and not anywhere else; I looked forward to them. Now with the internet, we\'re watching the same commercials we see on TV every day.\r\n\r\nGoing to the theater has become so much less of an experience and more of a hassle that it makes me wonder if in the future all movies will be released straight to digital format, available for rent or purchase at your leisure. The modern theaters we have today may have the same fate as the once beloved drive-in.\r\n\r\nI often think of or hear ideas that I believe would make things better:\r\n\r\n1) Let people bring their own food. The concession-stand should basically be a small restaurant. If it\'s good enough, then the majority of people will buy their food in the lobby anyway because it\'s not a meal they can get anywhere else.\r\n\r\n2) Have a section of the lobby to sell souvenirs / collectibles and keep the inventory regularly updated for all the current attractions. This is exactly what theme parks do, as soon as you get off the ride you exit through the gift shop. It\'s convenient and gets people\'s attention.\r\n\r\n3) Have LED screens installed in the restrooms so people can scan their ticket stub while using the facilities and continue watching the movie they paid for, so they don\'t miss anything.\r\n\r\n4) Offer better membership benefits with the option to upgrade. Anything from early seating access to private parking. You know, things that make people think they\'re actually VIP.\r\n\r\n5) Have some type of silent alert system installed on every theater seat, so people can conveniently notify you when there is a problem with the picture, sound, temperature, or an obnoxious viewer. Nobody should have to get up and leave to try and track somebody down.\r\n\r\n6) Get rid of the fucking TV commercials.\r\n\r\nTLDR: I think modern movie theaters really suck, how can we improve them?','Wonder Park',2,29,'2015-06-11 10:52:21'),('39li04','OBJECTION!!!

(Spoilers, obviously).','Firstly, if I miss something here, fair enough, I\'m not great at dissecting films and I saw it a few weeks ago now. It has been bugging me now how highly this film seems to have been universally rated, especially since I had a constant sense throughout the film that there was going to be some clever twist, which I feel it failed to deliver.\r\n\r\nSo the AI (Ava) passes Nathan\'s test, fooling Caleb and getting him to help her. We see that the AI is very capable of faking empathy, social/emotional manipulation and uses these tools to achieve its goal of escaping. We eventually see that Caleb has been completely fooled and that the AI is indifferent to his fate. Was this supposed to be a plot twist? I suppose it was not yet established whether or not Ava\'s \'feelings\' for Caleb were genuine but it wasn\'t really a surprise to find out that they were not. Human beings are capable of this level of manipulation and treachery and we had no good reason to suspect Ava was treating Caleb in any other way than Nathan had revealed.\r\n\r\nThe bit that really bugs me is that really the AI didn\'t do anything particularly smart in order to free itself. Nathan admits Caleb was the perfect target for the AI and lo and behold it all plays out as he hoped (Ava passes the test). Then comes the insanely lazy \'Nathan is a drunk\' plot and Ava is allowed to escape because his security sucks. This felt so weak to me. Sure Nathan was super arrogant but this was just all too stupid for words. He was taken aback that Caleb might try and think *one* step ahead of him? And is it just me or does this completely detract from the scariness of the AI, she duped an idiot who in turn duped someone who didn\'t take a basic security measure. Surely if Ava had actually been pitted against the most complex security and failsafes Nathan could dream of and get past them through some overwhelming feat of intelligence, that would be scary. Dude was drunk and left his keycard freely available for stealing. If this was meant to be some real world warning/message against AI about how dangerous it is, at least show it overcoming the height of human ingenuity, rather than a schoolboy error. People aren\'t scared of the idea of an unfriendly AI because human beings can be really dumb, an unfriendly AI is scary because it could defeat the most sophisticated human security imaginable with laughable ease. Maybe the point here was just that our arrogance will be our undoing or something, but that just seems like a truism, we probably won\'t need an all powerful, unfriendly AI to destroy ourselves.\r\n\r\nThat aside, I also thought that what turned out to be a massive red herring, the whole \'what is consciousness\'/turing test spiel, was going to be the real focus of the film. Instead it was set up as if it was going to be developed, the daily philosophising between Nathan and Caleb, and then we got the scene with Caleb starting to think he might be a machine. This turned out to lead nowhere and Nathan\'s test was just \'the AI can fake human emotions and manipulate people really well\'. If I was Caleb I would probably have been a bit more impressed that Nathan had created a ridiculously advanced robot/synthetic human.\r\n\r\nAnyway... someone explain what I am missing here. For what it is worth the visuals and direction were great and the performances too, loved Oscar Isaac. It just felt like it was going somewhere and then predictable things happened, AI proved it was AI, humans were silly, yadda yadda. Please don\'t hurt me.\r\n\r\nTLDR - What was so good about this film? AI proved  it was capable of social manipulation, Nathan was a bit of an idiot, so was Caleb.

And even if you argue that its period portrayal is over-the-top, wardrobe etc..., I don\'t think it detracts from the film\'s quality too much. And I know Jennifer Lawrence pisses people off enough with the roles she portrays, but her role isn\'t prominent enough to be that big of a deal, and I\'m pretty sure she\'s supposed to play a dislikable character to begin with. Moreover, I actually had thought I liked Silver Linings Playbook better, but watching them back to back, I actually like American Hustle better because it\'s more ambitious and fortunately lacks a lot of the unrealistic romantic tropes SLP plays to.

It stars Tobey Maguire, Liev Schreiber, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Peter Sarsgaard.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFHvH9FtACg) is the trailer, in case you haven\'t seen it.  The movie\'s due out in September.\r\n\r\nThe movie is the story of chess prodigy Bobby Fischer, from growing up in Brooklyn to his attempts beat the best players in the world (most of whom were Soviets) and win a world championship.  For the most part, it’s your standard by-the-numbers biopic.  E.g. it opens at a crucial moment in the story to draw you in and then flashes back to build to that moment 90 minutes later; it’s about a tortured genius who battled a lot of personal demons; it’s a period piece and the historical context is very much a part of the story; etc.  That doesn’t mean it’s not interesting, but it’s definitely nothing ground-breaking.  That said…it’s a pretty strange movie.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, yes, it’s about chess.  Not the most cinematic of games, but it actually works.  It’s compelling.  Secondly, the main character isn’t exactly a “hero but with problems,” like, say, John Nash in *A Beautiful Mind*.  He’s more aligned with Howard Hughes in *The Aviator*, i.e. an asshole who’s undeniably brilliant, but an asshole nonetheless, and oh by the way, he has problems.  Bobby Fischer is both the protagonist *and* the antagonist.  Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), the Soviet world champion that Bobby has his sights set on, isn’t really antagonistic.  Bobby is his own villain, to the point that there were times when I wasn’t sure who to root for.  \r\n \r\nWhich brings me to the third reason this movie is strange.  The movie sort of shifts focus in the build up to the climax.  I don’t want to say too much for fear of spoiling anything (not that there’s much to spoil, these kinds of stories have some of the most predictable outcomes), but suffice to say I’ve never seen a movie follow one character for 95 minutes, follow a different character for the next 15 (which are usually the most tense minutes, leading up to the climax), and then conclude with the original character.  It kind of muddled the pay-off a bit.  I feel like they needed to completely swap the second half of Act II with the first half of Act III.\r\n\r\nThe performances overall were commendable (especially Peter Sarsgaard).  Tobey Maguire was convincingly crazy and confident, and Liev Schreiber speaks almost exclusively in Russian, so that’s cool.  But overall, it suffers from the same problem *The Imitation Game* had; the title cards at the end of the movie, which tell you what happened to the protagonist after the events of the movie, sound like they’d make a much more interesting movie than the one we just saw.  \r\n\r\nIt’s definitely worth checking out though, especially if you like chess, Cold War period pieces, or stories about torturous genius.  \r\n','The Prodigy',5,9,'2015-08-26 12:53:56'),('3iiwsc','What would Paul Newman\'s best movie be?','Or just your personal favourite..','Hustlers',7,22,'2015-08-26 18:38:22'),('3j1ghn','Thoughts on \'The Hunt\' (2012) starring Mads Mikkelsen?','Personally I thought that it was a great film with a solid concept, phenomenal directing and of course, the acting was well above par. \r      It\'s one of my favorite, if not the favorite, foreign films; but my partner and her parents didn\'t seem to enjoy it once we sat down to watch it. \r\rWhat are your thoughts on it? \r\rAlso, what are some other great Scandinavian films of the same calibre that I should check out?','The Hunt',0,15,'2015-08-30 23:35:27'),('3j8ay2','Podcast interview with Molly Ringwald talking about watching The Breakfast Club with her daughter and how she saw the movie from the parents\' point of view, not the kids\'.

Obviously they are not all well-received: Fantastic 4 (both the noughties films and the one we just had), Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man films and X-Men: The Last Stand have all underwhelmed at the box office or with critics (and in some cases they\'ve failed on both fronts).\r\n\r\nBut for the most part superhero movies seem to be one of the few genres that seems to occupy the best of both worlds - the sort of widespread mainstream appeal that translates into droves of people seeing them in their local cinema on release day AND the pure quality of really well done action, comedy, drama and spectacle that makes them a hit with critics too (as opposed to say the big-budget wonders of something like Transformers or possibly even The Hobbit series, that seem to attract nothing but ire or indifference from a lot of film reviewers).\r\n\r\nMarvel in particular is hitting nothing but home runs in this area - people fucking LOVE these films, myself included. Even the ones that are often seen as missteps (Thor 2, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk) have a lot to love and are packed with thrilling and humorous moments. And if we take the Marvel films that absolutely kick ass, we have some very strong films indeed - Guardians of the Galaxy, Cap 2: The Winter Soldier, Avengers, and Iron Man are all films that border on perfection for superhero tales, with the acting, direction, visual effects, soundtrack etc. all coming together brilliantly to craft truly wonderful films. \r\n\r\n(Personally I\'d argue that Iron Man 3 should also be considered as one of Marvel\'s very best, but there is a huge divide of opinion about this film. I\'ve also left Age of Ultron and Ant-Man out of the films I\'m considering in terms of this argument because they\'re so recent). \r\n\r\nLikewise on the other side of the coin - DC. The Christopher Nolan directed Batman trilogy has had an absolutely insane effect on action and superhero cinema, and the culture of movies in general. Never before had anyone seen a comic book movie that was so entrenched in a world that looked like ours. Nolan took the biggest superhero of all time and made him seem real, and made a trio of films that were (and also probably will be for a long time) the most mature superhero films people had seen so far. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which - Watchmen. Proving that a genre that was seemingly a firm mainstay in the family/young adult demographic could be something else, could be 18 rated and full of sex and violence. There was some understandable backlash against this very stylistic take of Alan Moore\'s graphic novel, but for the most part Watchmen is seen as an absolute comic-to-film masterpiece.\r\n\r\nAnd Zack Snyder obviously enjoyed playing around with superheroes because he went on to make Man of Steel (after Sucker Punch, which almost feels like a comic book movie that just happens to not have any source material), a film that brought Superman to our modern times in a similar way to Nolan\'s depiction of Batman. And this has kicked off DC\'s own aspirations to a shared universe of films featuring their tentpole heroes, which will commence with next year\'s Batman v Superman, which is without a shadow of a doubt the one cinematic experience of 2016 that myself and a whole fuckton of other people are excited for most of all.\r\n\r\n(Of course, Civil War is a very, VERY close runner up to this, because I\'m a warm-blooded human with a soul). \r\n\r\nSuperhero films stand to dominate the box office and popular opinion for at least the next decade (and I fully expect Marvel\'s excellent run will continue long beyond Phase 3), and so I was thinking to myself - why no Oscar love for the genre?\r\n\r\nNow, there have been some Academy Award nominations for superhero films, which I shall list below:\r\n\r\n* Guardians of the Galaxy was nommed for the Oscar for Best Make-Up and Hairstyling\r\n* X-Men: Days of Future Past, Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier, Avengers Assemble and each film in the Iron Man trilogy was nommed for Best Visual Effects.\r\n* Iron Man was nommed for Best Sound Editing\r\n* The Dark Knight was nommed for Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects. \r\n\r\nAnd it\'s The Dark Knight that gives us the sole couple of Oscars awarded to the superhero genre:\r\n\r\n* Heath Ledger won for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the Joker.\r\n* The Dark Knight also won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing.\r\n\r\nThat\'s it.\r\n\r\nTwo Oscars, and 14 nominations (almost half of which are for the Dark Knight).\r\n\r\nAnd aside from Heath Ledger\'s win, all of the Oscar nods have been outside of what is seen as the \'Top 6\' categories, namely:\r\n\r\n* Best Picture\r\n* Best Director\r\n* Best Actor\r\n* Best Actress\r\n* Best Supporting Actor\r\n* Best Supporting Actress\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here think that the direction/acting/quality of some of the best ever superhero films is especially short of the standard we see at the Oscars? It\'s easy to see the Academy Awards as the home of awards-baiting \'serious\' movies, but more and more films that are atypical of the usual Oscar fare have been winning the big awards of late e.g. The Hurt Locker, No Country for Old Men, The Departed, and LOTR: Return of the King are a few recent Best Picture winners that I don\'t think anyone could describe as \'Oscar-baity\', and each of them are thrilling films filled with action and excitement. Outside of the winners we\'ve been seeing movies as varied as Juno, Django Unchained, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Captain Phillips, Zero Dark Thirty, Black Swan etc. all picking up nominations for Best Picture. \r\n\r\nThere is no narrow genre or type requirement to be considered for this award; whether your film is a psychological horror, an offbeat film about teen pregnancy, an action-packed thriller or a profane and bloody western, you\'re eligible for the Best Picture Oscar. So why are superhero films thus far neglected in this category?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of westerns, the superhero film is often compared to this genre of cinema. The Western experienced something of a \'Golden Age\' in the early to mid 20th Century, with actors like John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Gary Cooper dominating the movie theatres in tales of cowboys and heroes. Since then the Western genre has retreated into the background of modern cinema, appearing now and then in films like Django, True Grit, and Unforgiven - quality undiminished, but nowhere near as prevalent. Whether or not this will happen to the superhero genre remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nI also think it\'s interesting to note that, despite being a huge part of America\'s culture (and offering up absolutely amazing films such as The Magnificent Seven, High Noon, The Searchers, etc.), only 3 Western films have won the Best Picture Oscar:\r\n\r\n* Cimarron in 1931\r\n* Dances with Wolves in 1990\r\n* Unforgiven in 1992\r\n\r\nSo only one film that you could say came from the \'Golden Age\' of Westerns ended up winning Best Picture, with the other two coming almost in quick succession in the 90\'s, long after Westerns were the *de rigueur* of Hollywood. \r\n\r\nWill this be the case with superheroes? Right now, whilst they occupy a stature of mega-popularity with audience and critic alike, will those who judge the Academy Awards continue to turn up their nose at them? If indeed they are, I\'d love to hear what other people think about why they may have been mostly ignored by the Oscars thus far.\r\n\r\nAnd in a few decades when the superhero trend has run its course for the most part, and filmmakers are creating movies that are ostensibly part of the genre but can still act as commentaries upon it, will we see the first \'post-modern\' superhero movie get an Oscar for Best Picture, or any of the \'Top 6\'? \r\n\r\nLet me know if you\'ve got any ideas on this subject, I\'m really curious about this whole thing.\r\n\r\nAs a way of wrapping up, here are the films and actors/actresses I think have been worthy of Oscars (or at least for nominations) in the superhero genre:\r\n\r\n**Best Picture** - Watchmen, The Dark Knight, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. \r\n\r\n**Best Director** - Watchmen, The Dark Knight, GOTG, Captain America 2: TWS.\r\n\r\n**Best Actor** - Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man 3)\r\n\r\n**Best Actress** - I hope I can put Captain Marvel/Wonder Woman here in a few years because right now I\'m coming up short in this category.\r\n\r\n**Best Supporting Actor** - Tom Hiddleston (Thor or Avengers Assemble, Mark Ruffalo (Avengers Assemble), Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen), Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2).\r\n\r\n**Best Supporting Actress** - Scarlett Johansson (Avengers Assemble)','Spider-Man: Far From Home',2,62,'2015-09-08 12:41:31'),('3kgg8b','Gosford Park/Downton Abbey','Despite not being very big into television, I have nevertheless gotten hooked on Downton Abbey.

On the other side is Crimson Peak which came in at a disappointing #4 with $12.8 million, the lowest wide release opening ever for Guillermo del Toro.','**Top Five Of The Week:**\r\n\r\n| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Goosebumps | $23,500,000 |$23,500,000 | 1 |\r\n| 2 | The Martian | $21,500,000| $319,197,016	  | 3 |\r\n| 3 | Bridge of Spies | $15,380,000 | $15,380,000	 | 1 |\r\n| 4 | Crimson Peak | $12,850,000	 | $26,250,000	  | 1 |\r\n| 5 | Hotel Transylvania 2 | $12,250,000 | $267,509,388| 4 |\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:**\r\n\r\n* Nostalgia won the weekend as Goosebumps managed to perform above expectations and dethrone The Martian with a solid $23.5 million take. The film, which had a modest budget of $58 million, banked on the recognizability and love of the Goosebumps brand and won as the film scored much better with audiences than critics and looks to be a great domestic earner. It will have little competition in the way of family oriented entertainment until the release of the Peanuts movie in November, so it could conceivably pass the $100 million domestic mark. This also marks the best non-animated Jack Black led film since Nacho Libre all the way back in 2006. \r\n\r\n* While Guillermo del Toro continues to be attached to more aborted projects than anyone in Hollywood, the films that do make it to the screen tend to fair worse and worse. First Pacific Rim opened under Grown Ups 2 and now Crimson Peak has made half as much as Goosebumps with almost the same budget. Many analysts are blaming the marketing, as the film which ended up focusing more on romance than horror has seemed to disenfranchise audiences and led to a very steep drop off each day of the weekend. What this means for del Toro\'s massive slate is unclear but the director just seems to be cursed to be a cult filmmaker who wants to be a box office darling. \r\n\r\n* The Martian continues it\'s steady march of success, dropping very little from last week with a solid $21 million take, pushing it to be the third best domestic grossing film for Ridley Scott behind Gladiator and Hannibal. This marks another great domestic take for an original sci-fi film after Gravity and Interstellar and could push the action-adventure space drama into the new blockbuster format, particular with the fact that The Martian was made for much less than the bigger box office fair of the summer. \r\n\r\n* Bridge of Spies opened under expectations, especially for a collaboration between Hanks and Spielberg, but for a film made for $15 million the film is performing decently enough. It could speak to the fact neither are the immediate box office draws they once were, but early reviews and the appeal to the older crowd could mean some steady legs for the film. \r\n\r\n* Room (not The Room) seems to be primed to be one of the indie hits of the Oscar race as it\'s $120,000 premiere in just 4 cinemas proved this weekend. The Brie Larson drama seems poised as a Best Actress hopeful but early buzz may push it to be a great indie success at the box office, earning 1/10th of the entire run of Larson\'s last Oscar contender, Short Term 12.\r\n\r\n* One of the buzziest films of the year due to it\'s release is Beasts of No Nation which notably opened in both 31 theaters and to every Netflix subscriber this week. On the theater side, the film opened pretty poorly for a limited release, earning only $50,000 with a $1,635 per screen average. It\'s unclear if the intense subject matter or the easy access of the film online kept the audiences away, but ultimately the box office was never the true test of Netflix\'s strategy for the film. Any fan of TV ratings will tell you that Netflix is incredibly cagey with it\'s ratings reporting and it\'s likely we\'ll never truly know if Netflix was smart or not to pay $12 million for the film. Some analysts say that the low box office turnout and high torrent rate speaks volumes while other\'s say the theater boycott and massive attention for the small $6 million budget film has paid for the film in full just as a marketing tool for Netflix. Only time will tell if Netflix continues to buy up more exclusive films deals or mainly sticks with their original TV production. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Have John McClane go back there for a commemoration, a dinner in his honour, it doesn\'t matter what, you just need an excuse to get him back into the building. His ex-wife will be there too. Fuck the children.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have the building taken over again. Have him captured, shoes taken off him, vents, too old for this shit etc. The aftermath of terrorists arriving writes itself. Down below he could be in contact with a normal cop, in the Veljohnson role, who the filmmakers will hint at the end could end up taking his mantle.\r\n\r\nThe people who take it over could be doing it for two reasons: to get John McClane, or to just be terrorists this time. Cast someone charismatic as the villain, have John McClane get the shit kicked out of him, but have him survive until the end.\r\n\r\nAt the end when he faces off against the villain he\'ll somehow die saving his ex-wife, ideally throwing himself off the building holding onto the villain.\r\n\r\nHave a funeral where people from the past films are all there to pay their tributes, and then cut to the ordinary cop getting back to his normal job protecting and serving.\r\n\r\nEnd\r\n\r\nIt\'s fan service, completely, but at this stage that\'s what the series needs. It needs to play into what it\'s good at and into the age and experience Willis has. It brings closure to his lifecycle as the character, whilst also passing the torch on.

This weekend was terrible and next week seems to be headed for the same awful fate. The only one of the five new releases to make it in the top 5 was The Last Witch Hunter, which barely made $10 mil on a $75 mil budget. It swapped places with Crimson Peak and it seems likely the failure puts a nail in the idea that Vin Diesel is a big enough star outside of ensembles like Guardians of the Galaxy and Fast & Furious.  \r\n\r\n* Universal is feeling the pain for the first time all year. No one is going to doubt Universal\'s incredible success in 2015 but they aren\'t exactly ending the year with grace. First Everest seemed like a monster hit in IMAX yet fizzled out in wide. Then Crimson Peak vastly underperformed on a significantly high budget for a small scale horror film. Now Steve Jobs, their big entry into the prestige picture race, didn\'t capture the early buzz and only opened to $7.1 million at #7. While it opened slightly better than the 2013 film Jobs, the film\'s better critical acclaim did not translate to a good wide release. Many are pointing to the strong limited release as a testament that Universal made a mistake going with the old model of limited to wide for smaller films and should have opened wide at the height of the film\'s media attention. This combined with the terrible drops for the wide release of Everest and The Walk could mark a significant move away from the limited to wide release model in the future.\r\n\r\n* Boy this weekend was bad. While the $10 million budget of the new and supposedly final film in the Paranormal Activity franchise isn\'t monumental, it is high as it tried to use 3D and more special effects to end the franchise on a major box office note which seems to have not paid off, as the film opened at #6 with $8.1 million. Part of that decline is that film was boycotted by several major theater chains for failing to follow the tight VOD window they impose on new releases. Many are questioning why Blumhouse would push the 3D gimmick yet then rush the film to VOD as it could potentially have hit the top five without the boycott. Still the VOD sales will likely keep the film profitable but clearly the series will end on a whimper rather than a triumph. \r\n\r\n* Did you know this weekend was really bad? Well here\'s one more little story for you. Remember when [We Are You Friends opened so badly it was the main focus of my box office roundup for that week](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3j3kfg/box_office_week_the_slowest_weekend_at_the_2015/)? Well not one but two films topped it\'s #3 worst spot and still it\'s not the biggest story of the week. Yeah, it\'s that bad. However their failures are certainly noticeable, so let\'s get into it. First up is the Bill Murray vehicle Rock the Kasbah which marked the return of both Murray and director Barry Levinson to the wide release and boy did it fail. The film was savaged by critics, marking some of the worst reviews of both the actor and director\'s careers, and managed to be the #4 worst new wide release opening of all time at $1.5 mil with a per theater average of only $750 for the weekend. However Rock the Kasbah can take solace that while it was slightly worse reviewed than the following film, it did make slightly more than Jem & the Holograms which was more savaged by fans of the original 1980s TV cartoon than critics (though critics didn\'t love the film either), the film was the #3 worst new wide release opening of all time with $1.3 mil and a per theater average of $547 for the weekend. Many claim the trailer killed this one as it showed the film weirdly A) had almost no relation to the original cartoon and more baffling B) relied entirely on nostalgia for that cartoon. \r\n\r\n* One last little note, do you know who released Jem & The Holograms? Universal. So now Universal can proudly(?) say that not only did they make more money than any other studio in a year or that they have the #1 best opening weekend of all time, they also have the #3 worst as well. What a weird, strange year it\'s been and it\'s not even over for another two months!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

[SPOILERS], of course.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, these movies are about The Shoveler, William H. Macy\'s character in Mystery Men. He is actually the old man with the shovel who saves Macaulay Culkin\'s character from the Wet Bandits at the end of Home Alone. Mystery Men tells the story of The Shoveler\'s greatest adventure, his glory days, when he found his true calling and became the man he was meant to be. Home Alone is the story of how he got dragged back into his crime-fighting ways one last time, his final ride, his last hurrah, his Unforgiven, if you will. \r\n\r\nSure, they have different names. That can be explained. His first wife and kids leave him in Mystery Men. When he\'s older, he retires from his superhero career as The Shoveler and Eddy (William H. Macy) goes into hiding, changes his name. His first wife took the kids and left during/shortly after Mystery Men. This is covered in the movie, if you don\'t recall. Eventually he re-marries. This is the family we see as adults in Home Alone. They\'re reuniting and coming together again after years apart. Why? Because Eddy, now Old Man Marley, was always out fighting crime when his kids were growing up. And all these years of coming and going at night, always with a shovel, had fueled rumors of Old Man Marley being a serial killer. This is how Kevin McCallister and his siblings know of him. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O1CRcBd08) is when we see him shoveling ice/salt/snow in his driveway. \r\n\r\nThen one day, good old Eddy notices the nice neighbor boy is in trouble. Two low-rate crooks are burglarizing the McCallister house. What\'s a guy who shovels well - shovels *very* well - supposed to do? Why, he goes in there and saves the day of course.\r\n\r\nIn summation, Mystery Men is a prequel to Home Alone.\r\n\r\nIf you need any more proof, I present [Exhibit A.](http://i.imgur.com/ZCHPxhi.jpg) \r\n\r\nI rest my case.

But it is magical.','I don\'t know if I\'m allowed to link to it, seeing as the cut is only available via torrent, but the editor\'s name is \'Underhilleditor\', and the cut is called \'There and Back Again - A Hobbit\'s Cut\'\r\n\r\nIt reduces all three Hobbit movies to a single, 3-hour piece, closely following the story of Bilbo Baggins - and no one else. \r\n\r\nGone are the unnecessary prologue, most of Azog and the orcs, Legolas, Tauriel, the entire Dol Goldur subplot, and more than two thirds of the entire last movie. Gone is most of Jackon\'s slapstick, most of the visual gimmicks, most of the awkward LOTR references and, in fact, gone is most of the action. The action scenes that remain are: a little bit of troll action, orcs in the misty mountains (vastly reduced), spiders, a tiny bit of Smaug carnage, and a 20-minute version of the Battle of the Five armies.\r\n\r\nInstead the film is true to its title. There and back again. A film that feels and looks a little bit like Fellowship of the Ring, about a small guy and his adventorous, magical journey to the mountain looming in the background. This is the movie that many wanted to see - and this cut works. For the most part.\r\n\r\nRivendell is a bit wonky, Beorn is a mess, Thorin\'s anger at Bilbo\'s uselessness doesn\'t quite work anymore because of the missing action scenes, Thorin\'s madness in the last act comes out of the blue, and there\'s the odd not-quite-clean cut, but for the absolute most of the three hour run time, this is a perfected version of Jackson\'s film.

Do you agree it seemed like an unfinished film?','As I saw little to no constructive critic regarding Spectre I decide to start this new post, mainly due to the fact I find it interesting that almost no one here discusses how weird, chaotic and insulting the movie is considering the talent involved.\r\n\r\nNow, I consider myself a semi-fan of Bond franchise, being 36yrs old movie buff I’ve seen all Bond ventures during the years. I like the direction the franchise went with Craig, and generally agree with the common evaluation of Casino Royale being great, QoS being awful (except for the intro car chase which I think should get a lot more love), Skyfall being beautiful but kind of silly. \r\n\r\nNow Spectre I, personally find insulting for an intelligent movie goer. What unsettles me is a tendency I see in many reviews that it went back to its roots (which I think is a label people give to this movie due to its simplicity, however in my opinion it is not the case) while no traditional motives are to be found here used properly or serving the movie right.\r\n\r\nSpectre seemed to me like a hasty cut prepared for an early test screening, there were some errors (obvious Craig’s stand-in in the opening scene, having much darker hair showing from underneath the skull mask), many scenes made literally no sense,  others seemed like written by 12yrs old.\r\n\r\nNow some examples (some spoilers obviously):\r\n\r\n-	The criminally underused Monica Bellucci character “plot”. She is obviously a target of the criminal organization, Bond saves her, bangs her and leaves her in the span of like 3-5 minutes, while she clearly states that more assassins are to come to kill her. Ok, I get it, he only needed info from her, still some few lines of dialog of him directing her to leave city, or whatever would be fine. Really weird.\r\n\r\n-	The Rome chase. Horrible, childish “comic relief” scene with grandpa driving little Fiat car with airbag blowing. Boring, unimaginative chase without end is following, he simply crashes the car and leaves. And why it had no ammo? It was supposed to be delivered to other agent.\r\n\r\n-	The plane chase. How/when did Bond get the plane? Some few takes scene when he boards it would be fine – I was not sure their intention was for the viewer to not to be sure who pilots the plane in the beginning of the chase or was it a silly mistake.\r\n-	The scenes in Blofeld’s lair were like last second addition or additional reshoots. First the blatant meteor metaphor – we get it, we’re not dumb. \r\nThen the escape the torture device scene – first both needles miraculously did not hurt Bond, second, his watch’s explosion hits the villain and his computer which makes the torture device to automatically release Bond?! What is worth mentioning – in Casino Royale le Chiffre character simply got Bond tied to a chair in some abandoned dark place and hit his balls which was far more effective by being simple, realistic and terrifying. It was also fitting the new, more grounded angle the series went. Now we have devices straight from the Star Trek.\r\nNext we have the most ridiculous moment – Bond leaves the compound, gets the rifle from one of the henchmen and instantly becomes invincible. 20 guys shoot at him, he just stands and pow pow takes them down. Then he shoots some pipe with one bullet and all the compound blows out in glorious explosion like every inch of the place would be full of jet fuel and c4.\r\n\r\n-	Ridiculous “love plot”. We have like 3 dialogues of Bond and the blonde girl, still it is enough for the cold blooded assassin to fall in love, what he declares in clumsy dialog being tortured by the villain. So, so weak.\r\n\r\n-	The babe. They put an effort to give her a scene where she brags on her gun handling skills (btw it looked almost comedic when she let the clip slide from the gun in what was meant to be “skillful manner”) only to make her fail in literally next scene when she has to face the henchman who slaps her in the face during a shootout. Terrible writing.\r\n\r\n-	The final villain’s “trap”. Oh my god. First of all the setting – why on earth did he made an effort of putting all the photos in the buildings, spraying all the arrows when Bond was meant to be delivered there by his henchmen with a bag on his head. One can say – ok, the evil genius knew Bond would defeat the henchmen and come all by himself, still it made no sense. \r\n\r\n-	The stakes. There were none. In a pivotal moment Blofeld says Bond has two options. To die – it is a Bond movie, we know he won’t die, or to “live in despair” – sweet jesus, how difficult it has to be for a cold blooded secret government killer to live in despair! In Skyfall I was at least afraid for M’s life, here there’s literally no stake on the table.\r\n\r\n-	There’s also the weird, clumsy editing, very obvious in the finale. The chopper crashes on the bridge, due to the narrative of the scene we see that the events are following each other chronologically, still just few seconds after the crash the ambulances and police are there and the “police line do not cross” tape is already there for the people to not cross the bridge! Seconds, maybe a minute after the crash! Also, what I have yet to confirm in the train fight with the henchman the girl switches dresses between the takes in one moment, I swear I saw it, and my SO also confirms she saw it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acting from Craig screams “can I stop be Bond now, please?” in every scene, he sleepwalks through the film. Chris Waltz has his moments but they’re rather the moment of fine acting and fighting with dull, terrible lines of dialogues. Great Finnes was there to deliver some fine acting, still his M was rather reduced to a plot device and he didn’t have much to do with the character. Andrew Scott shined and was really outstanding giving what I think was the best performance in the whole movie.\r\n\r\nHoyte Van Hoytema’s camera work was awful in my opinion and was looking fine only in establishing shots – what is no surprise I think. I didn’t like his capturing of the action’s kinetics, the shots seemed choppy, lots of shaky camera and super short cuts. I was afraid it will be weak, even though I loved his work in Interstellar. No comparison  to Deakins’ work in Skyfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR – I don’t know what happened. Ether they were too tired, or they simple did not care. The final product however, was in my opinion empty set of following scenes, long and dull commercial with really incoherent subplots and weird decisions. No tentpole film should be such an insult for common viewer’s intelligence. \r\n','Super Intelligence',10,52,'2015-11-16 05:42:15'),('3t9jf9','The cut scenes and dialogue of The Dark Knight.','Recently, I was given a neat gift: The Dark Knight Trilogy (The Complete Screenplays). Having read them all, I wanted to share the differences, omissions, and interesting pieces of trivia that I noticed while going through. \r\n\r\n(Please keep in mind, that if you have any questions about the script, I\'d be happy to thumb through and answer them). \r\n\r\n**THE DARK KNIGHT**\r\n\r\n* The Heist\r\n\r\n(I found it interesting that each heist clown in the opening has a name, and that that name corresponds slightly to their personality.)\r\n\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\nHappy: the first shooter\r\n\r\nDopey: the alarm guy\r\n\r\nChuckles: the guy who gets shot by the bank manager\r\n\r\nGrumpy: the guy who sounds exactly like his name\r\n\r\nBozo: the Joker\r\n\r\n(The final clown is not named in the script, and his signature, “Hey, where are the other guys?” is missing.)\r\n\r\n(Another interesting tidbit is that several times throughout the early part of the script, camera direction indicates that we do not get a clear picture of The Joker, as seen here, after he shoots the anonymous final clown.)\r\n\r\n*Bozo pulls off his mask. The Bank Manager gasps. In the reflections of the glass debris behind the Bank Manager we see glimpses of a scarred mouth and clown make-up. The Joker.*\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* An extra joke with Rachel\r\n\r\n(When Bruce makes a surprise visit to Rachel and Harvey, there are a few cut lines from the conversation.)\r\n\r\nWAYNE: Let\'s put a couple tables together.\r\n\r\nDENT: I don\'t know if they\'ll let us --\r\n\r\nWAYNE: They should!

His Bodyguard moves at the Joker – who sidesteps – grips his head – slams it, face down, onto the table...* \r\n\r\n*The Bodyguard goes limp and slides off of the table. The pencil is gone. Magic. The Joker bows. Grins at Gambol.*\r\n\r\n(One thing I found interesting is that when Gambol asks Joker if he thinks he can steal from him and just walk away, there is no “--Yeah.” Making me wonder if it was a pitch perfect ad-lib from Ledger. We\'ll never know.)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Fox loves Chinese food\r\n\r\n(When meeting with Lau, Lucius tries to explain why he bothered to come to China.)\r\n\r\nLAU (cold): I think, Mr. Fox, that a simple phone call might have sufficed.\r\n\r\nFOX: Well, I do *love* Chinese food. And Mr. Wayne didn\'t want you to think we\'d been deliberately wasting your time. \r\n\r\nLAU: Just accidentally wasting it. \r\n\r\nFOX: That\'s very good -- “accidentally”. Very good. I\'ll be sure and tell Mr. Wayne that he was wrong about you not having a sense of humor. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Mr. Judge Surrillo\r\n\r\n(There appears to be an in-congruency in the script. Judge Surrillo is referred to as male in the direction.)\r\n\r\n*Judge Surillo turns the page. A playing card sits there. A Joker. He glances at it, curious, puts it to one side. =*\r\n\r\n(But later on, in the dialogue, he\'s referred to as a she.)\r\n\r\nMAYOR: 549 criminals at once?! How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?\r\n\r\nDENT: She shares my enthusiasm for justice. After all, she is a judge.\r\n\r\n(Probably just a casting decision, I just found it interesting that both sexes appear in the script.)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* So just what DID happen to The Joker after Batman jumps out of the penthouse?\r\n\r\n(This scene takes place immediately after Batman and Rachel land.)\r\n\r\nINT.

Smacks the back of the driver\'s seat.*\r\n\r\nDRIVER: What do we do about Dent?\r\n\r\nTHE JOKER: I\'m a man of my word. \r\n\r\n(Wish I could give you all more, but that\'s it, it just cuts back to Batman and Rachel on top of the cab. My bet is that The Joker and his men immediately fled after Batman jumped, realizing that they weren\'t going to get Harvey that time.)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n*  Mr. Reese\'s kids love Batman\r\n\r\n(Reese has a bit of extended dialogue when he attempts to blackmail Wayne.)\r\n\r\nREESE: Not with their numbers.

I always thought he was referring to the woman he sits with in the nightclub scene. This isn\'t the case. In the script, she\'s referred to as his mistress.)\r\n\r\nMISTRESS (shouting over music): Can\'t we go someplace quieter!

He\'s failed so far.\r\n\r\nDENT: How do you know what he\'s thinking?\r\n\r\nRACHEL (beat): I just do, okay? Harvey, this isn\'t just about you, what about all the people counting on you to turn this city around? Tell everyone the truth --\r\n\r\n*Dent kisses her.

Dent looks up in horror.*\r\n\r\nDENT: NO! Not me... Why did you come for me?!\r\n\r\n*Batman stares at Dent. The Joker lied. The counter hits five seconds. Batman drags Dent out. Dent fights to stay.* \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Yes, Lau dies, and it\'s horrible\r\n\r\n(I always wondered why it was only suggested that Lau burned. In the script, it\'s obvious.)\r\n\r\nTHE JOKER: Cut him up and offer him to his little princes. Let\'s show him just how loyal a hungry dog is. \r\n\r\n*The Joker\'s men grab the Chechen.*\r\n\r\nTHE JOKER: It\'s not about money. It\'s about sending a message...\r\n\r\n*The Joker watches the towering flames. Lau screams.*\r\n\r\nTHE JOKER: Everything. Burns. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Was the faulty detonator an ad-lib?\r\n\r\n(When the Joker blows Gotham General, we all know there\'s that great bit where the explosions stop and he\'s just like “what the fuck, explosions?” Well... it\'s not here.)\r\n\r\n*The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building.* \r\n\r\n*As he walks he pulls a detonator from his pocket. Strolling along, he pushes the button. Staggered explosions burst into the corridor behind him like demolition blasts... The Joker walks out of the door...*\r\n\r\nEXT. HOSPITAL – CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n*The Joker strolls down the steps – windows blow out in series. People dive for cover. Engel piles into a school bus.*\r\n\r\n*The Joker walks across the parking lot, the building collapsing behind him...*\r\n\r\n(A touch later)\r\n\r\n*The Joker gets on to the bus. Nods at his man at the wheel.*\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Preaching Bats\r\n\r\n(During the final confrontation with Two-Face.)\r\n\r\nDENT:  Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair. \r\n\r\nBATMAN: Nothing fair ever came out of the barrel of a gun, Dent. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* I remember in theaters wondering if Dent was really dead...\r\n\r\n*Dent lies at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken. Dead.*\r\n\r\n(Guess that answers that.)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n\r\n\r\n','The Woman in the Window',309,93,'2015-11-18 01:38:05'),('3tgs9a','What are your top 3 films from 2000 to now?','Mine are: \r\n\r\n1.

average. However, I always liked Ratatouille most of them all, but only saw it once since release, until now.\r\n\r\nJust finished rewatching Ratatouille which I haven\'t seen since like 2010 or something. And man, what a great movie. Without a doubt, in my opinion, it\'s the best Pixar has to offer to date. The art is fantastic, from the night Paris to the restaurant\'s kitchen it looks unbelievably good. Sure, some of the lighting and rendering is dated, but the overall package is superb. I didn\'t like how the character\'s skin looked sometimes, but the movie is from 2007, so not a big deal. It\'s shocking to me that this relatively old movie can look better than most other animated movies that came out since then. It\'s clear that a lot of talent went into making it.\r\n\r\nThe story is very by-the-book, like all Pixar stuff, but it\'s still very effective nonetheless. It pulls on all the right heart strings and who doesn\'t root for the underdog? The movie isn\'t very funny, but it\'s charming and everything. I didn\'t really liked how most of the characters are very very shallow, except for the main pair. The movie had more than half an hour to at least give a bit of flair to anybody, but it just overlooked them in favor of some antics and gags. That is my problem with most Pixar movies, and unfortunately, this one is no different. Still, they do their job for the most part. The effective design certainly elevates them. I did like how it\'s primarily a story of a rat and not some kid who can\'t do anything.\r\n\r\nI would, however, prefer if the cooking of the main dish of the movie had more flair to it. It was just anticlimactic a bit. Throw in some montage or something.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack from Michael Giacchino is just top notch, it embodies everything a romanticized Paris is. Romantic, it is. Still some of his best work, maybe even better than Inside Out.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great movie. Enjoyed it a whole lot and will definitely rewatch again someday with great pleasure, something I can\'t say about most other Pixar movies.  Oh, and these 2d animated credits are really neat. What do you think of it?','Isn\'t It Romantic',13,15,'2015-11-29 17:28:47'),('3uzycn','We are now less than a month away from the release of The Force Awakens. So /r/movies let\'s talk this subs plans for Star Wars, discussion threads, and spoilers!','So we are finally in the month of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens which means we are about to be basically for all intents and purposes a hair away from being /r/StarWars itself if we aren\'t careful. It is undeniable that in my few years of modding this sub that TFA without a doubt is the most anticipated film to ever be released in Reddit\'s life time. This easily tops The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar, The Hobbit, and The Avengers. As such we are going to be doing our best to keep this sub fun and safe for all fans of the Star Wars universe but also want to keep this a place for all kinds of films. As such here are a few things to know about Star Wars and /r/movies in the coming month.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n#**When is the Official Discussion?** \r\n\r\nOfficial discussion began as a way for us to keep the sub from becomings a hotbed of 1,000 different discussion threads right when a popular film comes out. While the nature of these threads has changed somewhat the core concept is vital for big releases like this. So as such **for the first week of release, all discussion for Force Awakens must take place in the official discussion threads. Otherwise it will be deleted.** Feel that you just have to make an independent thread about how much you hate Kylo Ren\'s boots? /r/StarWars is the place to go.\r\n\r\nBecause of the huge anticipation of the release, **we are doing a one-time only live discussion thread and a regular official discussion thread later.** The live discussion will start a few hours after the first public screening on earth (which is at around 5pm on 12/16 in the Philippines). That means **the live discussion thread will be posted on December 16th at 9pm UTC+08:00**. This thread is for people  to discuss with everyone in their own timezones. This thread will also **have no language restrictions** so you can discuss with people from your own country however you wish! There will also be a poll at the top of the discussion which will let those who wanted to stay spoiler free to gauge the general reception of the film. Also to be clear **both discussions will be spoiler friendly. Anyone who sees spoilers in the threads only have themselves to blame.**\r\n\r\n**The second thread will be posted on December 18th at 9pm UTC -6:00**. This thread will be posted as the main official discussion thread. This will give everyone in the world a chance to go to the first screenings and make their well put together thoughts. I know this means some of you will have to post at 3 in the morning but there\'s just no way around that. I am giving you the exact time so you will be able to pre-write your thoughts and know exactly when to be awake for the thread. \r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n\r\n#**What about spoilers?**\r\n\r\nSimply put, **if you want to avoid spoilers get offline.** You can try to install RES to take down Star Wars phrases or install that plugin that supposedly keeps you spoiler safe, but the best solution for once actually is abstinence. If you are planning on seeing The Force Awakens soon, then don\'t get online around 12/15 until you see the film!\r\n\r\n**We will not be making a non-spoiler discussion thread. Another user is free to make one, but they may not call it Official Discussion and we cannot garuantee it to be trully spoiler free.** Sorry but that requires too much work and ruins the brand. However you are free to make your own and report anyone who you think is spoiling. \r\n\r\n**If you see a spoiler, report it.** We have mods who will not be named who don\'t care about Star Wars (*gasp*) who will gladly go into the breach and pull any assholes who are ruining it. **Unintentional spoilers will be removed, intentional spoilers will get you banned!** We are dead serious about this. /u/girafa singlehandedly killed every book reading GoT spoiler dick in this sub. Don\'t cross him.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n#Can I post my reaction gif, video review, blogpost, fan art?\r\n\r\n**[NO! NOOOOOOOOOO!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_rc4ltH27A)** There\'s this amazing place called /r/StarWars. That is where you put everything. They are the place for every little bit of Star Wars minutia you can have. Please go there. For us only a few professional reviews and analysis will be allowed if that. We may even make a review roundup thread.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWell hopefully that\'s all.

Oscar Isaac is our new Robert DeNiro. The guy is just an extraordinary actor. Compare him in this movie and A Most Violent Year. I didn\'t even know it was the same actor until I checked IMDB. His range is just incredible.  But anyway enough about OI.\r\n\r\nI noticed something on the second viewing and I wanted to ask people about my theory. To me, the cats are a metaphor in the film, but a metaphor for what? I have read a few theories on here and elsewhere which posit that Ulysses (the UWS Gorfein\'s cat) is supposed to be a metaphor for Llewyn\'s dead duet partner, Mike. And that the Gorfein\'s are actually Mike\'s parents which is why Llewyn gets so upset when the wife/Mike\'s mother starts singing Mike\'s part at Llewyn\'s impromptu dinner recital of Fare Thee Well in their apartment. But that just doesn\'t ring true to me for some reason? The Gorfein\'s age, the fact that Mike doesn\'t share the same last name (though I guess it could have been a stage name). It just seems needlessly complicated to me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, onto my theory which I have not read elsewhere but may be floating around, who knows. The cats (don\'t forget there are 2 actually, Ulysses and the Stray) represent Llewyn\'s children. In the instance of Ulysses (the Gorfein cat) LLewyn spends most of the movie assuming that the cat is dead after he lost him. Only after he gets back at the end to the Gorfein\'s apartment does he realize that Ulysses is safe and sound in his home. This mirrors Llewyn\'s mistaken assumption that his baby with his previous girlfriend is also dead and only midway through the movie does he discover that his child is safe in Akron with his ex. \r\n\r\nThe Stray, on the other hand, is a clue about the paternity of Jean\'s baby. In the cafe scene, Llewyn and Jean are debating whose fault the pregnancy is, with Jean operating under the fear that the baby is Llewyn\'s. In the middle of the conversation, Llewyn spots the Stray and mistaking it for Ulysses (his cat), he runs outside and brings it back to the cafe table. At that moment, Jean tells Lllewyn she doesn\'t know the Gorfein\'s cat but both proceed under the assumption that it is Ulysses. This mirrors Jean and Lllewyn\'s mistaken assumption that the baby is Llewyn\'s, when in fact, it is not.  It\'s actually Jim\'s baby with Jean (or maybe even Pappi\'s?). This also helps answer whether Jean actually has the abortion in the end. She does and Lllewyn pays for it. We can assume this because Lllewyn also hits and presumably mortally wounds the Stray on his way back from Chicago at or about the time Jean is supposed to be getting her abortion. Usual qualifications about all metaphors being imperfect, yadda yadda.\r\n\r\nSo that\'s the theory. What do you guys think?

These movies are slapstick-comedies gone dark, but only in terms of aesthetic (subject matter to a lesser degree).

So, what would you all classify that first set of movies as?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, do you have any other suggestions for this genre? I love these kinds of movies.

Star Wars on Friday or Saturday and Sunday?','Potentially the biggest box office weekend to date is this week making this week\'s pick a nice little puzzle. The movie nerd in me decided to check it out when I saw it here on /r/movies a couple weeks ago. \r\n\r\n*Here are the rules before reading the rest of the post, for those interested who aren\'t playing:*\r\n\r\n**Here\'s what movies for this week cost:** http://imgur.com/WqEJxre\r\n\r\n**Rules:**\r\n\r\n* There is a 2 Billion loss for every open theater\r\n\r\n* Multiple screens can show the same movie \r\n\r\n* We get a budget of 1,000 movie credit point things/bux\r\n\r\n**The Situation:**\r\n\r\nRight now I\'m debating Fri vs Sat and Sun. To pick the opening day it\'s requiring 803fb out of 1,000fb, and it\'s only for that day. It\'s completely understandable that the movie is split up into three days at the box office to make the game more interesting. \r\n\r\n**Largest Box Office Openings Data**\r\n\r\n* [Days](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/days/?page=open&p=.htm)\r\n\r\n* [Weekends](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/)\r\n\r\nLooking at the box office data of opening days vs. opening weekends I gathered that it is likely that sat and sun picks are likely to gross more that fri together by maybe $10-20 million at most if this movie is as popular as it feels on social media, reddit, work, friends, and so on. I myself don\'t remember a movie with popularity like this coming out *on Christmas*, leading to the idea that maybe the statistics of movies in the past won\'t help much in predicting the box office for this week.\r\n\r\n**My First Choice:** I want to pick Friday The Force Awakens because I can pick movies for all eight theaters and pick last week\'s highest earners at the box office or one movie opening this week, within the budget. However, *this is Star Wars VII* and it\'s right before Christmas. That being said the Star Wars picks are only for fri, sat, and sun each, not the box office for the whole week. Picking friday also means I don\'t get to pick both of the two other opening movies this weekend. At least with Friday I get the potentially largest opening day in history, and some other movies that will be counted on xmas. After seeing how opening days rarely match saturday and sunday I began to consider picking the other two days or even just saturday and counting other movies make enough to beat the other players. \r\n\r\n**The Gamble:** I can pick Saturday and Sunday TFW, hoping both are greater than Friday as with research tells me is likely to happen but probably not by more than $10-20 million. \r\n\r\n**Third Option:** Picking only Saturday TFW. In the ideal outcome for picking only saturday, TFA earns enough so that the inclusion of the previous week top earners and the two new releases Sisters and Alvin and the Chipmunks (Which i only found out about through researching for this week) can beat the friday and sat+sunday pickers. This idea led to this post. How much will the other movies earn compared to Sunday?\r\n\r\n*Important note:* I\'m also playing in the View\'s league and I have to beat them. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?

Force Awakens also just edges past Jurassic World for the highest worldwide opening weekend at $528 million.','**Top Five Of The Week:**\r\n\r\n| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Star Wars: The Force Awakens | $247,966,675 |  $528,966,675	   | 1 |\r\n| 2 | Alvin and the Chipmunks: Road Chip | $14,400,000 |   $14,400,000	  | 1 |\r\n| 3 | Sisters  | $13,420,000 |  $15,220,000	   | 1 |\r\n| 4 | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 | $5,650,000 |  $595,538,774	 	   | 5 |\r\n| 5 | Creed  | $5,085,000 |  $95,500,073	  | 4 |\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:**\r\n\r\n* Welp. What else can you say but never bet against Star Wars. Any lingering thoughts people had that Star Wars: The Force Awakens would not have the biggest opening weekend of all time (*cough*thisguy*cough*) were thoroughly proven wrong. While the weekend didn\'t match the craziest predictions of $300 million, it did throughly squash the previous record of $208 mil set by this year\'s Jurassic World. The almost $40 million extra on top of that means the new record of $247 million will probably stand for some time...until the next big Star Wars film most likely. While early reports, [including my own](https://redd.it/3xpb7w), claimed Force Awakens did not beat Jurassic World, Disney is now confidently reporting that Force Awakens earned $528 mil just edging out Jurassic World\'s previous worldwide opening of $524.6 mil. This also means the $61 million new numbers for Sunday makes it the highest grossing Sunday ever as well. The only day record it didn\'t beat was Saturday, but that may be due to the extreme frontloading of Thrusday/Friday. The record opening Friday pull of $120.5 mil alone was enough to break the former December weekend record of $84 million for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The film set so many records it\'s honestly just best to list them all below, courtesy of Box Office Mojo. \r\n\r\n* Of course the big question remains, will The Force Awakens beat Avatar? While these $4 billion worldwide predictions are a bit much it is possible for The Force Awakens to beat the monster king of the box office...but it\'s not a certainty. First let\'s look at domestic. The record there for Avatar is $760.5 mil. In this race Force Awakens winning seems most likely. Big films released in December tend to have a 3-3.5 multiplier for domestic opening, which means we are looking at a potential domestic haul of $740 - $865 mil, so it is very possible for The Force Awakens to beat Avatar here and maybe even become the first film to gross $800 mil in domestic. The tougher one will be international. While performing incredibly well in foreign markets, Force Awakens still underperformed under Jurassic World\'s international opening numbers (Force Awakens earned $35 million less than Jurassic World in international numbers). Also even if Force Awakens earns $800 mil domestic it would still have to make the insane $2 billion international that Avatar made to earn its worldwide record of $2.7 billion. That\'s double the entire international haul of Jurassic World, the current third highest grossing film of all time. A big step in that will of course be China, who\'s $200 mil haul for Avatar was a big help. However the original trilogy of Star Wars just premiered this June in China and the prequel trilogy earned a measly combined box office of $18 million total. This country in particular could mark a huge roadblock in The Force Awakens chances at the worldwide record. \r\n\r\n* Oh yeah, I guess some other films came out huh? First up is the surprising fourth entry in the Alvin and the Chipmunks quadrilogy, Road Chip which came in second at $14.4 mil. This marked a not all too surprising low point for the franchise and while its second weekend chances could actually be higher than opening, it\'s unlikely this animated film will pull enough kids out of Star Wars to justify its $90 mil budget. Then there\'s Sisters, which performed reasonably well in third at $13.4 mil, a good haul for the R-rated $30 mil comedy. While its low Cinemascore may keep some new audiences away, the film\'s lack of comedy competition will likely lead it to a respectable $60-$70 mil haul. Meanwhile In the Heart of the Sea felt the worst post Star Wars sting dropping an abysmal 69% for a weekend haul of $3.4 mil. \r\n\r\n\r\n**The Major Records Set by The Force Awakens**\r\n\r\n>Domestic Opening Weekend: $247 million / Previous Record: $208.8 million (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>Worldwide Opening Weekend: $528 million / Previous Record: $524.9 million (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>Largest Thursday Previews: $57 million / Previous Record: $43.5 million (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2)\r\n\r\n>Largest Friday, Opening Day, Single Day: $120.5 million / Previous Record: $91 million (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2)\r\n\r\n>Largest Sunday, Single Day: $61 million / Previous Record: $57.2 million (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>Top Opening Weekend for PG-13 Rated Film: $247 million / Previous Record: $208.8 million (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>December Opening Weekend: $247 million / Previous Record: $84.62 million (The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey)\r\n\r\n>Fastest to $100 Million: 1 Day / Previous Record: 2 Days (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>Global IMAX Opening Record: $48 million / Previous Record: $44.1 million (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>Domestic IMAX Opening Record: $30.1 million / Previous Record: $20.9 million (Jurassic World)\r\n\r\n>The biggest opening weekends in the following countries: UK, Australia, Russia, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria, Poland, Denmark, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Ukraine, Iceland, Serbia, and New Zealand. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

It felt like an hour long film, yet so much was covered and I yearned for more. The soundtrack was beyond amazing, the depth of character had me enjoying characters coming on screen, and some not so much (which was the intended idealogy) and im once again taken aback with the constant question ever since Wolf of Wall Street and his infamous Cerebral Palsy scene;\r\n\r\nHow the hell does Dicaprio not yet have an oscar!?\r\n\r\nWhere do I start with this miniature masterpiece.....\r\n\r\n**The Plot**\r\nPlot wise, it\'s about as standard as they come; Hardy and Dicaprio star as Hugh Glass & John Fitzgerald as Fur Trappers with a company of 30 men, dwindling down to 10 within the first 5 minutes of the film, which stunned me with its pacing and dark delve into an already bad situation, gorey mess aside. With scenarios eventually culminating in Glass being left for dead and on the roam for vengeance against his would-be killer, the tension never lets up, even as we cut away from Dicaprio crawling his way out of a makeshift grave, to Hardy trying to explain his way out of a predicament. It truly sets the scene and scope of the situation from two differentiating standpoints that ultimately culminate in the two stars clashing in a fight well worth the 2 hours. \r\n\r\nNow, as much as as Hardy and Dicaprio\'s acting enthralled me, what truly got my attention? The bear attack. \r\n\r\nGood God, it was nerve racking.\r\n\r\nFor the better part of 5+ minutes, we see Dicaprio fight for his survival with nothing more than a single rifle round, a knife and his wits, getting slobbered all over and thrown around like a ragdoll and torn near enough to shit was beyond amazing. The end result was the biggest mess of tumbled hugsies since Anakin & Padme on the hills of Naboo, only with MUCH MORE of an emotional impact. The trailer, evidently, doesn\'t do it any justice whatsoever.\r\n\r\n**The Soundtrack**\r\nThe soundtrack itself, at it\'s core moments upon setting a scene, sent shivers down my spine and had me on the edge of my mind, fearing the next sudden movement would start a flurry of events that could only put Dicaprio in more knee-deep shit. it\'s eerily beautiful and scary at the same time and goes hand-in-hand with the dark and heart wrenching moments we come across. Case and point; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkRTaxYH_rE\r\n\r\nIt gives off that sense of dread and that musky, early morning smell when being in the wilderness, like there\'s **something** to be feared, but you wouldn\'t know until it\'s too late. it\'s a feeling that, after watching this film, I\'ve grown attached to, and the music in this film goes unamiss with that feeling throughout.\r\n\r\n**The Locations & Scenery**\r\nThere were some shots in this film that blew me away with it\'s natural aesthetic and gorgeous landscape. The locations feel as natural and fluid as they come, and being a woodland loving person that has somehow **NEVER** camped, i envy such beautiful tenacity of such a open landscape and it\'s dangers. Then again, this is the 1800\'s in harsh winter conditions; As beautiful and sharp as it may be, it\'s not worth diving into head first.\r\n\r\n**The Letdowns**\r\nMy only downside to the film, which is a very minor spoiler, evolves around the Pawnee chieftain on the search for his missing daughter. As much as i\'d like to say his character was well met and plugged thorough holes in the story...he really doesnt; He progressively ends up as being the Start & Finish of the film with not much depth. However, saying that, i liked they tried to include such a minor storyline. You know how they say theirs 2 sides to every story, 2 faces to every coin? The pawnee chief is much like the smooth running edge to said coin, but in comparison to the faces, will have its bumps and scratches, but nothing really of immediate interest or value.\r\n\r\n**Overall**\r\nI liked this film. Alot. Way more than I had originally anticipated. With other Westerns, such as Bone Tomahawk, Ridiculous 6, The Hateful Eight coming out, and a slew of films going under the radar, it\'d be an insult to Iñárritu to not say this film is well worth the admission ticket and the future blu-ray purchase. You can really tell he put his heart into this, even if he put the cast through hell. The ending, too, gave a mirror image to what Dicaprio\'s career has been doing all along; Reaching out for something that\'s just out of reach, yet, after everything he\'s been through and all that was accomplished, is well deserved.\r\n','Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark',1,1,'2015-12-22 21:52:40'),('3xxzir','The Revenant: Man Vs.

(No Spoilers)','I when the movie was coming out about a month or so ago, I remember reading about how it was “Underwhelming” and what not. This plus the fact that no one I knew nieces and nephews included had seen it, led me to believe it was a flop.  \r\n\r\nWell, I was wrong. Very, very wrong. I really enjoyed it. More so than I expected and maybe that contributed. I went in thinking Oh well and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved everything from the strong contrast between the photo realistic environments and stylized cartoony characters to the terribly trippy.\r\n\r\nIt has that trademark Pixar charm coupled with a classic Disney heart hitting story. The supporting characters are very akin to old westerns where sometimes you just didn\'t know who to trust and it is surprisingly dog eat dog \r\nfor a kids flick.  \r\n\r\nIt\'s basics boil down to a heroes journey set to a western backdrop. From there you move in to a boy and his dog but Pixar didn\'t just leave it at that, so the boy is the dinosaur and the dog is the caveman boy.  And it works so very well.\r\n\r\nI love all sorts of films and rarely so I feel the urge to write about them, but this on struck a chord.  Don\'t let the anti-hype sway you and go see this film.

Setting a personal record wouldn’t entirely do what I did justice though. More like shattered my old record and laughed at the notion of its very existence.

It’s one of the most profound scenes in a blockbuster movie that I can remember - and it basically encompasses what the film is about. While it could have been good by simply effectively executing action scenes and laying its simple plot out, it goes above and beyond the call of a typical movie to provide three central characters - Rey, Finn and Kylo Ren - and use them as metaphors for things many people experience and are faced with on a daily basis. Every scene seemingly has a purpose, and its plot is simple yet captivating and easy to get invested in. It has a great sense of humor and develops every single character effectively. And, it’s practically universally loved.\r\n\r\n2. **Room**:\r\nIt’s essentially two movies, with the first half serving as a great depiction of how love and family can help humans persevere even though the worst situations imaginable, while the second focuses on the burden society places on us to be normal and how it reacts to mental health and what is considered normal. Brie Larson gives the year’s best performance, and her 9-year-old co-star Jacob Tremblay gives the best child performance in years, and the best supporting actor performance of this year. Additionally, the rest of the supporting cast - including Joan Allen and William H. Macy - are effective. It’s suspenseful, funny, gripping and poignant.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Brooklyn**:\r\nThe best romantic movie in years, it doesn’t revert to the conventional tactics that so often bring down movies involving two people discovering what loves is. The lead female doesn’t get mad at the male, and he doesn’t have to win her over again. It’s an honest portrayal not only of how relationships work, but how they work when up against restrictions and expectations placed on us by society. The performances are great, it has a good sense of humor, and overall it knows the right pace to carry itself with and never overstays its welcome. It has an effective and emotional ending that heightens its commentary. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. **Ex Machina**:\r\nIt’s hard to be unpredictable in cinema today, but Ex Machina never gives a remote glimpse of the hand it holds. The performances are great, and its unique look and feel make it memorable, as does its disturbing ending that goes a long way toward making its commentary poignant and its message heard loud and clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. **Mistress America**:\r\nFunniest movie of the year, but at less than 90 minutes it still says enough about millennials and feminism that you’ll be thinking about it for a long time once it ends. You never quite know where it’s going, but the dialogue is perfect in that it conveys a lot in a short amount of it, yet feels natural and like how humans would talk given its settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. **Sicario**:\r\nAn intense movie that will mainly be remembered for the great performance from Benicio Del Toro, though I’d argue Emily Blunt is just as effective - if not more so - and carries the film’s weight and makes it work while giving the finest performance of her career. It’s non-stop riveting, even though at times I found its plot to be confusing on convoluted. But, no movie had me on the edge of my seat - literally - than this one, especially given that much of it takes place in scenes involving long takes and shoot outs. But above all else, it is able to effectively balance its commentary on the war on drugs and the toll that takes on us, as well as feminism and the role women can and should play in making politics work.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. **Joy**:\r\nYou may be asking how a movie that didn’t get much love from the critics is this high on my list, and the answer is simple - I can handle movies that are overtly about feminism and how bad a society dominated by patriarchy can be. A lot of movies this year were subtle when it came to their feminist agenda - and I say that as a badge of honor, not in a derogatory sense, so calm down! - but this film basically just came out and said what it was thinking. Jennifer Lawrence gives another great performance and is able to bring emotional levity to the film about a woman trying to achieve her dreams through her passion and hard work. The scenes involving her and Bradley Cooper are especially touching and poignant in that they go a long way to carrying its message through. It has a good, subtle sense of humor and its cinematography was some of the best of the year. Very enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. **Jurassic World**:\r\nIf people could forget about Bryce Dallas Howard’s high heels for a god dang second they’d be able to see how great of a movie this is. From a pure entertainment standpoint it’s great - logical action sequences, a good sense of humor and scenes that effectively utilize a geographical setup to build suspense. But overall I found its commentary on our current society - obsessed with the next bigger and better thing - pretty profound. Sadly, most people missed its message, but you can’t fault the film for a lack of effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. **Mad Max Fury Road**:\r\nI don’t generally give movies a second chance, but after initially hating this movie, I’m glad I did - because it is great. The fact of the matter is, I will always say a great movie will be able to stand out on its initial viewing. That’s why this isn’t No. 1, or even remotely close to “Star Wars The Force Awakens” caliber. But, that’s only because it attempts to do so much visually and metaphorically that it’s hard to pick up on it all, causing lots of its greatness to be missed on its initial viewing. To its credit, it works despite its main character having very little dialogue and its plot being incredibly simple, and essentially just a 360-degree car chase. But, it infuses its narrative with a commentary and message regarding feminism with a never-relenting action style that is captivating, no matter how chaotic things can seem during that initial viewing. \r\n\r\n\r\n10. **Goodnight Mommy**:\r\nEasily the creepiest, scariest and disturbing film of the year. It executes its sequences of suspense  - which is virtually its entirety - to perfection, and never lets on where it’s going until it’s shocking and out-of-nowhere resolution that will leave pretty much anyone who can stomach it speechless. The performances from its two adolescent boys are impeccable and make everything work, which needed to happen given only five people appear in the movie and all of it takes place in a small house. It doesn’t particular have much to say, but that doesn\'t mean what it does can easily be forgotten.\r\n','Isn\'t It Romantic',7,17,'2016-01-04 22:04:20'),('3zipir','All the movies I watched in 2015','Movies of 2015\r\n\r\nI did this in 2014 and no one cared so I\'m doing one again because I hate myself.

Diary of a Teenage Girl\r\n\r\nAnd now, the bulk of the post, split into multiple sections because of character limits.\r\n\r\nThis is a list of all the movies I watched in 2015 in chronological order. Paired with each movie is a rating and some thoughts. I started doing this in 2014 for fun and now it’s something I plan to do for every year in the foreseeable future. In 2014 I watched 92 movies and this year I watched 124. For 2016 I hope to reach around 150 and my goal is to watch more old films since I rarely go back further than the 70s. If you end up reading this then you can read the whole thing or just scroll down to find movies you’ve heard of (or the highest rated ones). The quality of writing in this is pretty bad because I’m not spending too much time on each film but rather just doing a quick overview. Also I’m doing very little revising after I just vomit the words onto the page. The longer I write, the more fatigued I get too so see if you can pick out the ones I wrote when I was tired. Excuses, excuses. Anyway, thanks for reading and I’ll possibly/probably be doing more of these in the near future.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: There’s a top 10 of the year at the top and bottom if you just want some quick recommendations. \r\n\r\nMovies marked with an asterisk were seen in the theater.\r\n\r\n1. The Babadook: 6/10 – This Australian horror film was praised for being a return to form for the horror genre and caused quite the buzz online among film forums. I liked it when I first saw it but on subsequent watches I didn’t enjoy it as much and actually found it pretty average. But with some terrifying moments and a very tense atmosphere, it’s still worth seeing if you’re a fan of horror.\r\n\r\n2. Paranormal Activity 5: 3.5/10 – Yet another mediocre installment of the Paranormal Activity series. The first PA was a masterpiece of low-budget modern horror and revolutionized the genre in the same way Blair Witch did. Unfortunately, the rest of the series was no such masterpiece. If I were to rate them I would go: 1, 3, 2, 5, 4. PA4 was TERRIBLE. I don’t recommend unless you’re bored at a sleepover or something. \r\n\r\n3. Nightcrawler: 7/10 – This was getting a lot of buzz in late 2014 and I was lucky enough to get my hands on a Screener copy meant for the academy awards. This was one of the sleeper hits of 2014 and it really showcased Jake Gyllenhaal as a great actor. If you enjoyed Taxi Driver, American Psycho, and Drive (2011) then you’ll probably like this one. A true recommendation. \r\n\r\n4. American Sniper: 6/10 – Clint Eastwood’s newest movie, this one got a lot of flak for being an “American Propaganda” film. I, however, didn’t feel like it was propaganda. A lot of people criticized it for its negative portrayal of Middle Eastern people but those people probably don’t know anyone in the military. Coming from a Navy town, the negative sentiment towards Middle Easterns is how a lot of people in the military think and not just Eastwood trying to be anti-Muslim. I felt it was actually an anti-war film since it basically has the theme of “war follows you home” what with the PTSD experienced by Chris Kyle. \r\n\r\n5. Birdman: 9/10 – I loved this movie. I LOVED this movie. Michael Keaton killed it and Alejandro Iñárritu showed off his directing chops with this theatrical surrealist film. If you haven’t seen this yet then do yourself a favor and watch it. The Academy isn’t great but at least they got this one right with Best Picture. Watch it. \r\n\r\n6. The Road to El Dorado: 7/10 – One of my favorite animated movies and one I have a deep nostalgia for. This was one of those traditional animation films from the late 90s/early 2000s alongside Disney’s Atlantis that didn’t do well in the box office but would go on to become a sort of cult classic. \r\n\r\n7. Whiplash: 8/10 – After starring in the mediocre Divergent movies Miles Teller received his breakout role as Andrew Neiman in Whiplash. The real star of this movie, however, is J.K. Simmons who puts in an award-winning, powerhouse performance. If you haven’t seen this movie yet then you’re missing out. It also contains one of the greatest climax scenes in film history that will make you jump out of your seat with excitement (maybe that’s just me). \r\n\r\n8. Inherent Vice*: 8/10 – Paul Thomas Anderson is one of those directors whose films guarantee a good time. Other directors like this include Wes Anderson, the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino. Inherent Vice is no exception. Adapted from the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name, this movie takes place in 1970 Southern California. It really captures the end of the hippy era and a time when the future was relatively complicated and uncertain. It’s a somewhat neo-noir film like The Big Lebowski where there are many intersecting motivations and character arcs that influence you to try and piece together the story. If you’re a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (and you should be since he’s one of the best directors working today) then I would tell you to drop whatever you’re doing and watch this right now. You won’t regret it (although you might want to watch it twice since it is IMMENSELY confusing the first time). \r\n\r\n9. There Will Be Blood: 10/10 – Another Paul Thomas Anderson movie and arguably one of the greatest films of all time. This is what I consider a perfect movie. Daniel Day Lewis puts forth a legendary performance and secures his place as one of the best actors of all time. This is pretty much required viewing at this point. \r\n\r\n10. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou: 7.5/10 – I watch this a few times a year and I think it’s my favorite Wes Anderson movie (although Grand Budapest is pretty great too). Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-esque character who is washed up after the death of his friend and partner Esteban. He vows to find the shark that ate him and kill it. This gets a definite recommendation from me as it is one of the most accessible Wes Anderson films. \r\n\r\n11. The Mist: 6/10 – Adapted from a Steven King novel, this is truly a terrifying movie about a town enveloped by a mist that contains weird, murderous, otherworldly creatures. The CGI is a bit dated but the story is legitimately scary. Funny story actually, my mom took me to see this when I was like 11 and she apologized to me after it was over because of how disturbing it was.\r\n\r\n12. Project Almanac*: 2/10 – This movie sucked.\r\n\r\n13. Punch-Drunk Love: 7/10 – This Paul Thomas Anderson movie is probably one of his worst, which means it’s still pretty good. Adam Sandler gives a surprisingly great performance in this simple love story between a plunger salesman and a pretty girl. I need to watch this a second time. \r\n\r\n14. The Master: 9/10 – Paul Thomas Anderson you magnificent bastard. This movie starring Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) is a sort of criticism of Scientology that crosses over into the realm of surrealism. The Master is truly a mind-fuck and a masterpiece of a film in every sense. Might take a couple watches to “get it.”\r\n\r\n15. Wild: 6/10 – Reese Witherspoon stars in this adaptation of the novel of the same name by Cheryl Strayed about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. It was pretty okay and it gave me some serious wanderlust. \r\n\r\n16. The Big Lebowski: 9/10 – One of my favorite movies, Jeff Bridges stars in this late 90s Coen Brothers movie about a chill Dude who gets thrust into a plot far bigger and more complicated than himself. With a supporting cast of John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Julianne Moore, this film is a tried and true classic. \r\n\r\n17. Foxcatcher*: 5/10 – This movie received a ton of praise and the only reason I can think of is Steve Carell’s performance. It’s true that Carell was almost unrecognizable in this but the plot was so slow and meandering that it was an absolute chore to get through. I don’t recommend this one. \r\n\r\n18. Boyhood: 6/10 – DID YOU KNOW THAT IT TOOK 12 YEARS TO MAKE??? Of all the overrated movies, this is one of them. I can’t fucking believe that this got a nomination for best picture. With a bland “story” where nothing happens and an awful performance from everyone but Ethan Hawke, Boyhood is a true disappointment. Although it was a feat to make this over 12 years, it’s nothing more than a gimmick to me. The best thing about this was Vampire Weekend and Arcade Fire on the soundtrack. \r\n\r\n19. My Dinner with Andre: 9/10 – Wallace Shawn (INCONCEIVABLE) and Andre Gregory (famous theatre director) haven’t seen each other in five years and agree to sit down for a meal together. The result is literally two hours of them having a conversation. It is a movie devoid of all clichés and it is heartwarming as it is charming. I would definitely recommend this to fans of theatre since that’s how it resonated the most with me. \r\n\r\n20. Cinderella (2014)*: 5/10 – Another needless live-action reboot of a fairytale. The costumes were really good at least. \r\n\r\n21. The Imitation Game: 6.5/10 – Blueberry Cucumberbelt gave a great performance as Alan Turing but this was still pretty Oscar-baity. I enjoyed it though. \r\n\r\n22. Annie Hall: 10/10 – One of my favorite movies of all time, Woody Allen’s Annie Hall is regarded as one of his best alongside Manhattan and Hannah and Her Sisters. I don’t even know how to describe this film other than charming and overall just a masterpiece of cinema. Watch it if you haven’t. \r\n\r\n23. The Grand Budapest Hotel: 9/10 – Wes Anderson’s most Wes Anderson-y film to date. Probably his best. Of course I’m going to recommend it. \r\n\r\n24. Chef: 7/10 – An all around feel good movie. There was no real conflict in this at all, which surprisingly wasn’t a bad thing. Don’t watch this movie while hungry or you will die. \r\n\r\n25. Insurgent*: 4/10 – Stop adapting shitty young adult dystopian novels into movies please. This shit is cliché as hell. \r\n\r\n26. The Captive: 4/10 – A movie with Ryan Reynolds that I didn’t want to watch. My expectations were correct and this movie was not very good at all. \r\n\r\n27. World’s Greatest Dad: 6/10 – Robin Williams plays a dad whose son accidentally kills himself. Williams forges a suicide note to spare his son the embarrassment but the lie spins out of control. A pretty okay movie. RIP Robin Williams. \r\n\r\n28. Get Hard*: 5/10 – Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. Meh. I laughed a few times. \r\n\r\n29. It’s Such a Beautiful Day: 7/10 – This is an animated film by Don Hertzfeldt who you may know as the creator of Rejected (https://youtu.be/MuOvqeABHvQ).  This movie is on netflix and it’s pretty surreal and depressing. I recommend it if you’re having a good day and want to get all sad and introspective before crying yourself to sleep. \r\n\r\n30. Kingsman: The Secret Service: 7.5/10 – A real surprise this year. A pretty good R-rated spy movie with Samuel L. Jackson and some British people. One scene in particular stands out as truly great (if you’ve seen it you know which one).\r\n\r\n31. The Great Mouse Detective: 7/10 – An old Disney classic about Basil of Baker Street (aka Sherlock Holmes: mouse edition). A classic.\r\n\r\n32. Forgetting Sarah Marshall: 8/10 – One of the best comedies of all time in my opinion. It’s the perfect movie for after a break up or just when you’re feeling a bit down (or any other time really). Jason Segel and Mila Kunis kill it while Paul Rudd offers up some seriously quotable lines like, “When life gives you lemons, just say fuck it and bail.”\r\n\r\n33. Get Him to the Greek: 7.5/10 – One of those comedies you can watch over and over again. There are some seriously great moments in this movie like TJ Miller dealing drugs to Jonah Hill, the Vegas party, and the Today show bit. Russel Brand is especially great. \r\n\r\n34. A Serious Man: 8/10 – The Coen brothers are true geniuses and this film is no exception. Mirroring the story of Job from the Bible, this film follows a Jewish man as a series of terrible things happen to him. Highly recommended. \r\n\r\n35. The Last of the Unjust: 7/10 – At over three and a half hours, this Holocaust documentary is a spiritual sequel to Shoah, the ten hour documentary by the same director (Claude Lanzmann). A very important documentary but a very difficult one to get through.\r\n\r\n36. Avengers: Age of Ultron*: 6/10 –Joss Wedon is good at writing snappy, humorous dialogue but when there’s supposed to be a real threat like Ultron, all that does is kill any possible tension. Marvel movies are usually great but this was the weakest in a while. \r\n\r\n37. It Follows*: 8/10 – This was a real surprise. I had heard great things about this movie but finally seeing it was on another level of fucking amazing. The soundtrack is killer, the premise is great, and it’s a completely solid horror movie. If you enjoy horror then do not miss this movie.\r\n\r\n38. Ex Machina*: 8/10 – I knew nothing about this going in and I preferred it that way. Basically Oscar Isaac and Domnhall Gleeson (both rising stars) lead this amazing science fiction/drama film about AI and robotics. One of the best of the year.\r\n\r\n39. Wet Hot American Summer: 7.5/10 – I can’t believe I didn’t see this movie until now. Paul Rudd, Jon Benjamin, Bradley Cooper, Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, Janeane Garofalo, Amy Poehler, and Elizabeth Banks also star in this movie. \r\n\r\n40. Clouds of Sils Maria*: 6/10 – A real indie film. Kristen Stewart really showcases her acting ability here with a believable and honest performance. Chloe Grace Moretz also kills it. Recommended if you’re a hipster fuck who likes art house movies like me. \r\n\r\n41. Knocked Up: 7/10 - Can’t believe I didn’t see this until now. Great movie. Everyone knows this. \r\n\r\n42. Mad Max: Fury Road*: 8/10 – When I first watched this I didn’t really like it. It had so much online buzz as this huge movie that could be the best of the year. I guess my expectations were too high but I was really disappointed. On subsequent watches, however, I realized why the movie was so praised. The art direction of the film is amazing, the sound design is spectacular, and the camerawork is seriously impressive. When you’re watching it just think about how they got each shot. It will blow your mind. \r\n\r\n43. Ouija: 3/10 – This movie is ass. \r\n\r\n44. Jurassic Park: 9/10 – It’s Jurassic Park you know it’s good. \r\n\r\n45. Poltergeist (2015)*: 3/10 – This movie was awful and the original definitely didn’t need to be remade. Sam Rockwell was the only redeeming quality of this movie but even he couldn’t save it. \r\n\r\n','21 Bridges',6,14,'2016-01-05 00:25:56'),('3zjas8','Where does x-men go after apocalypse?','Any ideas?

It was such a letdown.\r\n\r\nA couple things I kept asking myself when watching this. I\'d love to hear your thoughts or explanations in case I missed something.  \r\n\r\n- How the planet cannon got power. From the sun and it depletes the sun in one shot. Then how did it shoot the first shot? Were there 2 suns? why the fuck make a bigger gun with ammo limited to suns that it was orbitting? Also even if that shot was light speed or 10x or 100x faster than light it would take millions of years to cross the galaxy. Then at the end it does a scatter shot to hit a couple planets? Also after no more stars, the planet would have no energy source and all life on it would die. \r\n\r\n- Kylo Ren being sith for 10+ years and getting ass handled by a non force using deserter with some PTSD and an untrained force user. \r\n\r\n- Super shitty shitty lightsaber battles. \r\n\r\n- Where was the republic fleet? They couldn\'t all have been deployed around the capital, there must have been numerous fleets for the whole republic.\r\n\r\n- How does the rebellion only have like 20-30 x-wing fighters in their fleet. They had 20+ years to rebuild since RoTJ where they had capital and cruise class ships. \r\n\r\n- How does the republic not know about a planet sized cannon that the first order built. There must have been many bothans who could die to get some intel. They don\'t do anything about it\'s construction, operations or deployment. \r\n\r\n- Who trained the Sith lord that trained Kylo stumpy Ren?\r\n\r\n- Where was Luke living? There wasn\'t any buildings on the island, or even a bathroom. \r\n\r\n- Rei is poor, but somehow she knows everything about every piece of technology and how to pilot when she\'s never been on a ship since 6. Where did she practice? Who taught her?\r\n\r\nThis honestly felt worse than the prequels. I\'m not convinced that George didn\'t write this. It felt like his writing through the whole thing.

To me, the most heartbreaking scene is the very last scene.','The scene I am referring to is last scene where Tilda Swinton\'s character, Eva, finally has a breakthrough with Kevin. They actually talk in their visiting session, and we see some regret/humanity out of Kevin for maybe the first time in the entire movie. For some this could look like a semi happy moment, but for me, it was the saddest part of the whole movie. We see her terrible relationship with Kevin through the whole movie, and all of her failed attempts to break through his wall. After Eva lost everything and Kevin was in prison, it seemed like it couldn\'t get worse for her. Everyone she cared about was gone, she lives alone and the community hates her. Then the last scene happens, and she broke through with Kevin. Now after losing everything and seeing what Kevin did, she connects with her son that she was never able to connect with before, and possibly cares about him more than she ever has before.

Jackson (The Hateful Eight)\r\n\r\nFor some of these, I paired people because some of these really were two-handed performances. Also, it was a way to cheat and get some more people into the top 15. Why didn’t I just make a top 20? I don’t know.\r\n\r\n1. **Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, “Room”**: Brie Larson’s been doing amazing work for a while now, and I’m so glad she’s getting the deserved attention for Room (also watch Short Term 12, if you haven’t already). She and Tremblay are incredible in their own rights, but their performances are entwined so much that it’s hard to separate them. It’s a touching and heartbreaking relationship, but it’s also hopeful.\r\n\r\n2. **Sarah Snook, “Predestination”**: This movie was a while ago. However, Snook’s performance has stuck with me over the past year, and she is simply a revelation here. It seems like every emotion in existence can cross her face at any moment–the plot can go off the rails a bit, but she gives the story emotional heft–and she knocks every tricky scene she has out of the park. In a lesser performer’s hands, this movie probably wouldn’t work.\r\n\r\n3. **Nina Hoss and Ronald Zehrfeld, “Phoenix”**: These spellbinding performances are some of this year’s most overlooked, and the movie’s exploration of exteriors vs. interiors are reflected in Hoss’s and Zehrfeld’s faces. There is subtlety, but also an undercurrent of unease (and eventually devastation).\r\n\r\n4. **Oscar Isaac, “Ex Machina”**: This guy is finally getting attention due to Star Wars, but we can’t forget what a brilliant performance he gives in Ex Machina. He uses the physicality of his character extremely well, and the way his character is both hemmed in and defined by his creation is fascinating to watch.\r\n\r\n5. **Walton Goggins, “The Hateful Eight”**: Now here’s a deliberately showy performance, and it works like a charm with Tarantino’s style. ‘Hammy’ should not be a criticism here because ‘hammy’ is exactly what works. Mannix is just so, so, so much fun to watch.\r\n\r\n6. **Abraham Attah, “Beasts of No Nation”**: This is not a showy performance, but that only makes it more impressive (if we’re talking singular performances, I’d put him above Tremblay). Attah is able to convey the impact of the world around his character with just one glance, and he plays stoicism so damn well; it doesn’t sound like something you would necessarily ‘play’, but trust me, Attah’s a star in this film.\r\n\r\n7. **Jason Segel, “The End of the Tour”**: This is a wonderful performance in a movie that is much better than I expected it to be. He and Eisenberg have great chemistry throughout, and it feels like he really does become David Foster Wallace in this. It’s a complicated man and a complicated performance, and Segel is perfect for the role.\r\n\r\n8. **Alicia Vikander, “Ex Machina”**: She’s getting attention for The Danish Girl, but that performance–and especially that movie–is nothing compared to this one. It’s not just her playing a robot; it’s her nailing all the mannerisms and complexities while also injecting a human element into it. She’s sympathetic but scary.\r\n\r\n9. **Jennifer Jason Leigh, “The Hateful Eight”**: How happy I am that she has two excellent roles this year. As Daisy Domergue, she spends all of the movie bruised and battered and covered in blood, and her character gets unleashed in the second half. It’s a thrilling and terrifying performance all at once, and she and Goggins steals the show.\r\n\r\n10. **Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, “Carol”**: Ask me to pick one, and I’d go with the heart of the film (in my opinion): Rooney Mara. That’s not to take anything away from Blanchett, however, who is still incredible as Carol; that’s just me praising Mara because of how amazing she is. The film rests on subtle glances and light touches, and the two actresses craft a very believable and moving romance.\r\n\r\n11. **Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, “The Revenant”**: This is admittedly the least ‘two-handed’ performance of the ones I’ve put on here, but whatever. Leo’s performance is great, and although he does rely on quite a few “Give me the Oscar!” faces throughout, we definitely should not overlook the difficulty of a purely physical performance. Hardy has the more intriguing character, but the performances are both fantastic.\r\n\r\n12. **Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay, “45 Years”**: I’m not the biggest fan of the film as a whole, but I cannot deny the power of these two performances. They slowly and surely illustrate how the past ends up widening a fracture in their characters’ relationship, and it all culminates in a breathtakingly beautiful final 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n13. **Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, “Mad Max: Fury Road”**: With Furiosa and Max, Theron and Hardy work in tandem to create one of the more compelling dynamics in film this year. The title is “Mad Max”, but it’s just as much–if not more–Furiosa’s movie, and Theron nails both the badass action elements and the emotional journey.\r\n\r\n14. **Mark Ruffalo, “Spotlight”**: It’s difficult to single out one actor in what is clearly an ensemble piece, but Ruffalo’s the one I’m drawn to. Yes, he’s clearly the one who’s doing the most ‘acting’–everyone else is wonderfully underplaying their roles–but he does it well. His big moment at the end is excellent, and his interactions with Stanley Tucci’s character are sublime.\r\n\r\n15. **Michael Fassbender, “Steve Jobs”**: The film works as well as it does due to Sorkin’s screenplay and Fassbender’s acting, and it’s without a doubt a great performance that the latter pulls off here. He captures the narcissism and rigid nature of the character, but also does justice to the softer side that arises later in the film.','A Dog\'s Journey',10,2,'2016-01-14 23:23:40'),('4129ew','The hunt for clues is back!

But the film functions like a great little sampler of horror film subgenres. There\'s demons, home intruders, elder gods, medical gore, all your favorites!\r\n\r\nThis might be the best horror anthology film since the original Twilight Zone movie. I think it beats both the VHS and ABC\'s of Death movies handily, though those each have excellent (and not so excellent) segments.\r\n\r\nThis one hangs together better than any of those, and each individual segment would be worth showing up for all on its own.\r\n\r\nGo see it if you can!

Growing up, I loved The Lion King and was so excited about the second part when it was announced.

Probably even more than the original. I mean, it\'s a children\'s film, so there is some cheap comic relief. But it doesn\'t drag it on, and allows adults to maintain their interest.

Sex and the City was another movie I found just terrible (haven\'t seen the show) but it\'s my understanding that the show was way more entertaining, even if that\'s not your sort of thing. However, South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut is better than any episode or multi-episode story line Matt and Trey have done on the show.\r\n\r\nMovies adapted from old tv shows seem to have much more success.

Despite 3 votes for “Big Hero 6”,  the guy holding the mouse decided we should all watch “A Serious Man”. So I started this movie with no expectations, no inkling what kind of movie it would be nor did I know the movie was by the Coen Brothers.\r\n \r\nThe movie opens with a couple in a pre-industrial setting. The man takes way too long to say “a wheel fell of our cart but an old acquiantance passed by and helped me so I invited them over” (this is actually foreshadowing all the dialogue for this movie) but then a dybbuk, a Jewish vampire, enters. Hold the phone, this movie is about vampires? Sweet, I wonder how they differ from the Transylvanian and modern day vampires. Bet they have some intruiging powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Will A Serious Man be kicking some Serious Butt?!? Au contraire, mon frère\r\n\r\nNext scene has us in a sunny suburb of somewhere USA in the 60s. Meet Larry Gopnik, a physics teacher (*sweet, I love it when a nerdy dude goes total rampage on vampires, I hope he builds lots of cool anti-vampire gadgets*).\r\n \r\nHe has a son. A daughter as well. And a wife. She wants a divorce and Larry is left behind shellshocked (*they’ll be kidnapped by vampires and Larry will have to save them, right? Man, this movie is so predictable ^yawn*)\r\n \r\nLarry gets in a car accident (*perfect, while you fix the car, outfit it with UV headlights and other weapons of mass vampire destruction*).\r\n \r\n    People talk.\r\n \r\nLarry may be getting a promotion (*good, a larger wage will fund more anti-vampire gadgets*).\r\n \r\n    People talk some more.\r\n \r\nLarry’s wife and her lover talk him out of his house without giving a reason (*Noooo, Larry, you need a safe haven, vampires need to be invited in houses, but hotels are fair game to them*).\r\n \r\n    People continue talking.\r\n \r\nLarry’s neighbor is planning to build a boathouse too close to the property line (*erhm ... is the neighbor a minion? The boathouse must be a cover to hide an underground crypt for his demonic master, right? Wait ... we’re already halfway through this movie? Ar- ... are Jewish vampires known for being outpaced by classical zombies? Are scenes 2 to 24 their garlic?*)\r\n \r\n    People must have an inherent fear that if they stop talking their lips will fuse, closing their mouths forever.\r\n \r\nLarry sees a rabbi who drones on about a parking lot (*Larry, stop visiting divorce lawyers and rabbi. Please drill through the parking lot and unveil a nest of vampires ... please for any god’s sake ... we’re already through half of the movie and nothing has happened so far*).\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n## Going to see this movie is like visiting Jurassic Park and staring at the cage with the cows. Sure, you can call them bos taurus of the bovinae subfamily and Rorschach the hell out of the spots on their fur ... but for the same money you could’ve watched the velociraptor feeding.\r\n \r\nIt’s around this point in the movie that I gave up hope. I had been suckered into watching an ‘everyday stuff happens to an average family The Movie’-movie. You know where else I can see that stuff? Every morning in my 75 inch bathroom mirror. The story of how they shipped that mirror like God-freakin’-zilla from China to my place is probably a more exciting story than “A Serious Man”. I bet 6 people where crushed in the glass mines working on this mirror (I’m usually not a betting man but their ghosts haunt my mirror so I’m pretty certain). Anyways, enough about my mirror, back to the movie review.\r\n \r\nYou know that HHG2TG bit “nothing happened ... then nothing kept happening”? It’s as if the Coen brothers took that phrase and inflated it the same way the tiny Hobbit book was turned into a trilogy of movies.\r\n \r\nAt least Douglas Adams has the decency to revel us with wit, wonder, woe and (w)other feelings.\r\n \r\nNothing in this movie entices an emotion from the viewer. Near the end a tornado offers you the satisfaction of seeing everyone killed by debris but immediately comes back on that promise by showing the credits. You’re not allowed to have feels in this movie. None whatsoever. At all.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n## This isn’t a ‘feel good’-movie ... it’s a ‘no feelz’-movie\r\n \r\nNow usually I don’t care much about character development in a story. A good plot takes care of this in a natural way. The lack of a worthwile plot however had me searching for anything to hold my interest.\r\n \r\n(tl;dr: I cared more about [this character with 10 seconds of screen time](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/walkingdead/images/d/d1/Jenny_jones_peekhole.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20140212010634) than about all the characters in this entire movie combined).\r\n \r\nThere are a certain number of characters in this movie. I already told you of Larry, the average guy to whom everyday stuff happens.\r\n \r\nBut there’s also:\r\n \r\n* a wife: she wants a divorce, she takes/steals his money, at some point her lover dies but when she lightly puts her hand on Larry’s arm their mariage is saved. I wish this was a character summary but I kid you not, this is all there is to her.\r\n* a son: he listens to music, he smokes 2 blunts, he owes a kid in class $20 and has a bar mitzvah. I wish this was a character summary but I kid you not, this is all there is to him.\r\n* a daughter: she argues with her brother, she washes her hair, she leaves the house with some friends. I wish this was a character summary but I kid you not, this is all there is to her.\r\n* a brother: shares Larry’s interest for mathematics, is too busy being in the bathroom all the time to provide moral support (or a much needed backbone) for his brother going through a divorce(can anybody explain what that noisy device is that he turns on at night?). It’s good we’re being told they are brothers, there’s no other way to tell.\r\n* the wife’s lover: he’s a widower and loves Larry’s wife is what we’re being told (though her moving in with him is somehow laughable? ... The movie never bothers to explain). He thinks a bottle of wine is compensation for somebody’s wife.\r\n \r\nThose were the important secondary characters. Then there’s this bunch of screentime wasters:\r\n \r\n* an Asian kid: he fails physics class, risks to lose a scholarship and bribes Larry (if you have the money for bribes (real value in 2016 is $25k), why do you need a scholarship? Wouldn’t that money be better spent on a math tutor?)\r\n* a neighbor: gives off a redneck vibe, disagrees with Larry on the property line (utters a dozen words in total, giving him the best dialogue of this movie)\r\n* another neighbor: she sunbathes naked and smokes 2 blunts. (Is it sad that this makes her the strongest female character in this movie? Yes, it is. Yes, it is.)\r\n* a rabbi: he’s in love with a parking lot. It may be an unconventional love but no little boys are hurt.\r\n* another rabbi: this one drones on for minutes about a message carved in teeth. Tells a fascinating ([/s]; or it would’ve been if I were still caring about anything anyone says in this movie) but pointless story (remember when I mentioned the dialogue in the opening scene was foreshadowing? Here the brothers felt they needed to do some midshadowing)\r\n* a third rabbi: likes Jefferson Airplane. Closest thing you’ll see to a vampire in this movie.\r\n* a lawyer: he listens when Larry talks. He suggests other lawyers for Larry to go see. (Is it sad when the epitome of affection in a movie about a man and his family comes from a lawyer man-hugging his weeping client? Yes, it is. Yes, it is.)\r\n* another lawyer: he sits down at a table opposite of Larry, aligns his pencils and dies. Great acting on the pencil alignment. You rarely get to see such expert pushing.\r\n* an unseen lawyer: he’s appointed to defend Larry’s brother, only mentioned once, doesn’t appear on screen. Best. Character. Ever.\r\n \r\nNote that Larry has no friends to turn to and nobody who tries to help him get his life back together.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n## Conclusion\r\n \r\nIt’s not a movie. It’s a reality show with a script. But not the good kind of reality show (if such a thing even exists), not the one that has you caring about the participants.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoteworthy moments | .\r\n---|---\r\nFunniest moment| when one person voted against watching “Big Hero 6” because they hadn’t seen the previous 5.\r\nScariest moment| when I bumped the mouse and saw the movie still had 40 minutes on the clock.\r\nMost Good Guy-est moment | sitting out the movie because leaving would mean I’d take my beamer with me and condemn the others to continue watching on a laptop\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\n&nbsp;\r\n \r\nImagine my surprise when, at movie’s end, only one other person voiced their dislike of the movie. Surely some of them fell asleep or were still sleepy and couldn’t contribute to the discussion?\r\n \r\nNext day come, I searched for other reviews on this movie. Never having heard of Jefferson Airplane (which is mostly on me, I guess, my musical knowledge starts and ends with the knowing which buttons turn my car radio on and off) the elder rabi scene was mostly lost on me) maybe I had missed other stuff? Most of the threads are archived so I’m gonna write here about what I found:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n> there’s subtle humor in it\r\n\r\n    Should I find it funny when bad stuff happens to somebody but anyone he turns to is most unhelpful?\r\n    Let me tell you about the parabel of this prank where they blindfold a person and kick him in the balls.\r\n \r\n> subtle plot\r\n\r\n    Somebody enlighten me here please. How is “everyday stuff happens to an average guy” a plot?\r\n \r\n> It’s about how life’s a mystery\r\n\r\n    a) No, it’s not. Everyday scientific discovery teaches us more and more about how life and the world around us works\r\n    b) Even if it were, do you need 2 hours of ‘no feelz’-movie to (non-)communicate this message?\r\n    c) I enjoyed the Vsauce video on the field of not-knowing better.\r\n \r\n> it’s very philosophical\r\n\r\n    A train heading for 5 people on a track unless you switch tracks so it hits 1 person is a philosophical/moral question (though I see it more as a lack of safety regulations and engineering defiency in the brake redundancies). Showing me an image of somebody and asking me for 2 hours straight “but what could it mean?” is just annoying. Go away.\r\n \r\n> it’s an abstract movie that requires you to think about it\r\n\r\n    I spend 2 hours not caring about anything happening to these people. Now you want me continue wasting time on it? I’d rather make sense of Doctor Who’s timestream and plot.\r\n \r\n> the point is there is no point:\r\n\r\n    Pick a wall. Any wall will do. I’ll draw in the same color of paint a point on that wall. Now stare at that wall for 2 hours and meanwhile I’ll be projecting a movie on the opposite wall. This compromise should give each of us the experience we both crave.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n## TL;DR:\r\n \r\n1. Everyday stuff keeps happening to an average man. Nobody cares enough about him to help. Then the end credits roll.\r\n2. Fuck you, friend who hogged the mouse and inflicted this movie upon me, next time I’ll be an equal dick and take my beamer with me.\r\n3. The adage “show, don’t tell” is reversed for this movie. It showcases that the road less traveled often is so for a good reason.\r\n4. I hope the tornado at the end kills all characters, blows the camera crew away , destroys all the tapes, retcons time and makes it so I saw an actual movie. You know ... one with a story ... an emotional rollercoaster (or even merry-go round would be acceptable by comparison).\r\n \r\n \r\nAuthor’s note: it’s been 48h since I watched this movie and the time wasted watching it still has me fuming (resulting in this rant of a review). Now I’m ***really interested in hearing your point of view***. I’d like nothing better than someone **shedding new light on this movie**, pinpointing what I missed and how it’s actually cleverly brilliant. If you post “Dude, you be trippin’ balls, this movie was the awesum” without anything specific to back your statement I apologize in advance for the post-rant tremors that my comments will contain.','Wonder Park',4,29,'2016-02-24 12:07:58'),('47fcma','Gillian Anderson to join Harrison Ford and Natalie Dormer in Official Secrets','','Official Secrets',7,5,'2016-02-24 17:09:54'),('47g9bg','We\'re the filmmakers and cast behind the movie Southbound, ASK US ANYTHING!','We are the writers, directors, producers, and cast of the new horror movie Southbound and we\'ll be online Thursday, February 25th starting at 9am PST to answer any and all of your questions.

I wondered how far in the past/future these movies were set when compared to the date of release.  I made up a list of all the Best Picture winners and I calculated the time difference.  Just so you know, if a movie was set over multiple years, I took an average.  Also, I mostly disregarded flashbacks or establishing scenes that do not focus on the main plot.  Finally, I haven\'t seen all of these movies, and so I relied used IMDB and Wikipedia to find the dates.

However, most pc video players, lots of blu ray players, and even tv\'s have normalization options you can check to make the audio more balanced from quiet to loud. My issue with this is it only works one way. I like having higher bit depth audio, 24 bit audio files can allow 24 levels of volume, and if it isn\'t your thing just check the normalize option. But it can\'t work the other way, if they start publishing blu rays or high quality digital downloads at 16 bit or 8 bit audio depth you can\'t get the quality back, you can\'t up that to 24 different levels of volume and get original 24 bit quality. I understand having this difference in audio doesn\'t work in all situations, but I want to have the option to watch high quality video and audio on a home theater set up, I want to replicate a theater experience with the best quality possible. And when I want to watch on some random device with balanced audio, the option is there.

I was wondering if anyone can help me find scenes, preferably from old B&W movies (film noir would be best), that captures the perfect cliche\' where an informant or spy meets a contact in the middle of nowhere and hands over information.  Preferably, I\'m looking for a scene where a note or a letter is passed, and the contact immediately reads the note/letter.  I\'m picturing an isolated park bench, or a shady back alley, or some meeting in the shadows, where someone hands over a note, and the note is immediately read.  Any scene from an old film that captures this, or some element of this, would be appreciated.  Really, any scene in which a note is passed and immediately read would work, as long as it has the feel that highly secret or classified information is being handed over.  A military setting might also work where classified info is being handed over to an official.  In fact, a military official being handed a note and reading it would be perfect for the point I\'m trying to make in my presentation, but a spy movie or private eye movie would also work.  Any suggestion would be appreciated.  Thanks. \r\n\r\nEdit: To be more specific, I\'m planning on editing the scene together to include a note that I\'m filming.  So, I will be cutting from the passing of the note, right when the character starts to read it, to a picture of my note with some text on it.  That is why I\'m looking for a very specific transfer of a document--so that it can cut together.

Here’s why: OK. $10 million movie, 60 million to promote it, that’s 70, so you’ve got to gross 140 to get out. Now you’ve got $100 million movie, you’re going spend 60 to promote it.

This is just my honest opinion\r\n\r\nOne of the critical darlings of the year in the SciFi world has been MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. Well, I’m going to set the record straight. This is not a good movie. It’s not even a passable movie. In comparison to the summer’s biggest hit, JURASSIC WORLD, a film that moviegoers dismissed before they even saw it, in comparison, George Miller’s ROAD WARRIOR update fails head to head in every single instance. Let me break it down for you, because I am SO TIRED of all the undeserved praise Fury road is getting. Needless to say, many spoilers follow.\r\nCHARACTER: The primary failing of Fury Road is that there are no characters in it. A character has to be a well-rounded personality who experiences a change over the course of a film because of the events of the film. Mad Max isn’t even the central figure in his own story. He does not change from the start of the film to the end (before you tell me how that’s how it always is go back and watch the first two Mad Max films – you are wrong). The events of the film might as well not even be happening for all the effect they have on Mad. He’s not ‘mad’ at all, he is in fact barely present. He just has resting bitch face the entire movie. The other ‘characters’ in Fury Road are just as one-dimensional. The baddie is just bad because he can be, our coven of women are just pretty faces with nothing to distinguish them and the only thing that makes Charlize Theron stand out from mindless horde of evil mob is that she is on the other side. We are told she’s the best captain, but she doesn’t demonstrate any particular skill in the movie more than anyone else, and reveals absolutely nothing about her inner soul such that the audience knows her. Critics rushed to pour praise on her bold feminist portrayal but as far as I can see, her gender is the only thing that makes her different from any one-dimensional and uninteresting Jean Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal character, and that’s nothing to be impressed by.\r\nIn comparison, every character of note in Jurassic World comes into the film with an issue they are trying to solve (whether it’s an upcoming divorce, an inability to break away from work, or disvaluing the importance of family) and they all arrive somewhere completely different by the end. The bad guy has a very specific plan for why he is doing what he is doing (Vincent D’Onofrio) and even the bad dinosaur has a pretty detailed backstory, both nature and nurture that places them in context. And they both learn and change methods throughout the film (in Fury Road they just chase… and chase and chase…). Jurassic World has a love story, and family story, and even a coworker story. These are not the deepest characters, but they all have emotions and personalities and character turns and surprises.\r\nPLOT: This is the easiest one to talk about, because Fury Road has NO PLOT. It’s just one extended chase scene. One way, then back. You would think that as they cross over ground they had already covered, there would be some sense of learning from where they have already been, but this opportunity is squandered as they just drive over the places they’ve already been with little regard to issues 40 minutes earlier. And this whole time they are racing over the desert, there are no particular guideposts along the way to overcome, its just goes on and on.\r\nBy contrast, Jurassic World features a very well-executed three act plot structure where all the players are set up in Act One, as well as the inciting incident – the ‘escape’ of the new dinosaur. Act two puts all these pieces into play in various stages of peril, coming together slowly to an inevitable plan in Act Three, where they attempt to defeat the evil. This doesn’t go as they hoped but they still in the end overcome it. Classic structure, executed with precision. Every detail and character choice that is set up in act one, is paid off in act three (In Fury Road, there is nothing to pay off because there is nothing set up).\r\nLOGIC: Fury Road doesn’t make a lick of sense. In this post-apocalyptic world where diesel and chrome are king, why waste gallon after gallon of precious fuel to take 300 cars and trucks in pursuit of the stolen women. And if even so, WHY GOD WHY would you waste the extra energy (and gas) to lug a forty foot amp with an electric guitarist chained to it across the desert. And why do these other cities come to the aid of the main baddie? What’s in it for them? And if you want to introduce them, why have them add basically nothing to the plot except be more cars chasing (sorry, that’s a plot and character complaint as well). For the heroes, how are these old women living out in the desert, presumably for years, with no water. They say they can’t go south, because who knows if there are resources there, but there are no resources here, so why stay? What are they waiting for? How are the people in the cities living with basically no water? What purpose does keeping them alive even serve our main baddy?\r\nIn Jurassic World, one could argue against the logic of making a new dinosaur, but that’s what the film is about, the central conflict. Everything else that happens in the film makes complete sense, right down to how the park would handle a catastrophe like this, character choices, and payoff of which dinosaurs eat which other dinosaurs. In fact, my favorite moment of the whole film is the relationship between Chris Pratt and his trained dinosaurs which is has more dynamism than any human relationship in Fury Road. In the end, when the trained dinosaur choses to protect Pratt as a friend and leader, I almost cried. It was a completely believable moment in an unbelievable world, and that is what is at the center of Logic. Jurassic World invents a place with its own set of rules. It doesn’t look like our world at all, but everything that happens there, happens for a reason and fits in. Fury Road doesn’t even follow its own faulty premise.\r\nLEGACY: I will admit, I was extremely excited about a new Mad Max film, and somewhat bummed that there would be a new ‘Max’ but of course, Mel Gibson is a racist jerk, so there’s that. That being said, there is literally nothing in this film that resembles the tone, character or world of the first two films, which if you may remember, were set only a few years after the apocalypse hits. And they are in Australia. I could never tell where Fury Road is supposed to be set, but it doesn’t seem to have any connection with a real world. Its as if the team had only watched the (arguably) awful Beyond Thunderdome. Of course you know that’s not true, because it’s the same guy. But that’s what makes it so disappointing. A lot of focus has been made of how much of the film is practical effects and not CGI – great, but if all of that work does nothing to forward the story who cares. The original films were basically souped up cars in the desert, and moody characters with something to prove or a reason to get even. This movie has nothing to share with the original but its title.\r\nIn contrast, Jurassic World is all about legacy, from the chills I got down my spine when the original theme played mournfully on the piano in the trailer to the extended sequence in the film where the stumble upon the ‘set’ from the original movie. Such a payoff! The film is also about the park being concerned with its own legacy, competing with itself, trying to raise the bar, while still putting all the early unpleasantness (and PR nightmares) behind them. The central theme of man not tampering with nature is the same as in the first movie, just explored under different (and more extreme) circumstances. The tone and audience for this film just seems like this generation’s equivalent of the audience for the original film. Fury Road really ends up feeling like a poorly executed over-blown Hollywood version of the original film, losing much of the charm of why those movies worked (just as was said of Thunderdome)\r\nFEMINISM: Much of the praise given Fury Road focuses on what has been called overt feminism in the narrative. Some of this has come from crazy right wingers complaining about it but those people are crazy so let’s ignore them and just look at the film and judge it by what it is actually trying to do. There are three sets of female characters in the film, the stolen brides, the desert women, and Charlize Theron. The stolen brides are about the least feministic execution of character possible. In the city they are prized merely for their beauty and sex appeal. Once stolen, they are still treated as sex objects. None of them are trusted as fighters or given guns, and when they adopt a baddie to their team, he very quickly falls into a romantic relationship with one of them… because that’s all they seem to be entrusted by the screenwriter to do. None of them grow or learn, and as a pack of scared screaming women, they are indistinguishable. If it wasn’t for their hair color, there would be nothing to differentiate them from each other. Not very feminist. The women in the desert are sort on their last legs of life, with no direction, as if to say, women will wander in a desert without a man to guide them. They are very ready to follow Max’s lead as soon as he shows up. And again, they are defined by group characteristics with very little to distinguish them from each other (oh one of them likes plants, how progressive is that? Why not one of them likes to eat snakes live, or can throw a knife a 100 feet on perfect target).\r\nFinally, Charlize. Charlize gets praise because she is treated in the film like a man. She is a bad ass, good with a gun and a knife and driving a big rig. But she is also completely stripped of her femininity. She takes no sexual interest in Max or any other male character and they basically make her look manish, as if to say a woman cannot be both feminine and an ass-kicker. Anyone ever seen Alien? The Terminator? Fifth Element? Even the original Star Wars films give us in Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia a woman who is gorgeous and shoot a gun. Firefly/Serenity did it quite well. Battlestar Galactica. In fact, check out this list on AfterEllen about kick ass female scifi heroines (http://www.afterellen.com/general-news/107375-the-top-40-kick-ass-female-sci-fi-characters). Why is making Charlize Theron more of a man than a woman a victory for feminism? To me, it’s actually MORE OFFENSIVE. And if you apply the Bechdel Test to Fury Road, I think it fails just as bad as say American Pie might. It has more than two women, but they have names like Capable and Toast, names that could be interchangeable amongst the group. Sure they talk to each other, but it is always about a man, because they barely talk at all and when they do it’s about who is chasing them, or Max. They are barley talked to by Charlize, who basically keeps them in the dark about her plans the whole time. I don’t know, I guess it passes, but not by much.\r\nJurassic World? I mean, its no trailblazer but Bryce Dallas Howard plays a very powerful business woman, a bit on the uptight side, who finds love and machine gun by the end of the film. She is just as important in defeating the renegade dinosaurs and saving the children and park guests as Chris Pratt, and along the way has several conversations with female employees about work and her sister about her own work choices. I’d say its just a normal well-written strong female character, no need to heap praise on it, but actually a better example of rising above a male-dominated world while still be allowed to be a woman than anything in Fury Road.\r\nI believe that Jurassic World should\'ve received the accolades that this movie robbed it of.','Isn\'t It Romantic',0,33,'2016-04-15 03:06:54'),('4evoci','Some might think it\'s a tragedy that Raul Julia\'s last film was Street Fighter','But I honestly think it\'s a good thing. \r\n\r\nMany young kids were introduced to him through that film, and the Addams Family.\r\n\r\nStreet Fighter is by no means a good film, but it\'s a guilty pleasure of mine.

There are many ways to see The Jungle Book. Here\'s some info to help you decide what\'s best for you.','Hi, this is Jon Favreau.    \r\nThanks to all of you who came out to see the Jungle Book.  Its warm reception around the world is extremely appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI’m posting because a lot of people are asking which of the seemingly endless list of formats I recommend to see the movie in. Let me start by saying that the answer’s different for everybody so I’ll try to cover as thoroughly as possible what the best thing is for each taste.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere is a very exciting new technology out there right now, and Jungle Book is the first film that has been released in the format. It’s called **Dolby Vision 3D**.  Unfortunately, there are only a handful of theaters that have it.  It’s a laser projection system with extended dynamic range. The black levels on the screen are extremely deep, the contrast levels are much higher and the brightness of the screen make for a 3D experience where the glasses disappear.  I think this technology is a game-changer and I applaud Dolby for this breakthrough and look forward to it being more widely available.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are the places where it’s currently available:    \r\n**Los Angeles:** El Capitan Theatre    \r\n**New York:** AMC Empire 25    \r\n**Chicago Area:** AMC Hawthorn 12    \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInternationally- Four locations:    \r\n**Two in The Netherlands** (JT Eindhoven & JT Hilversum)    \r\nCinesa La Maquinista in **Barcelona**    \r\nThe Cinelpexx in **Linz, Austria**    \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about it here: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re a fan of the big-screen format, **IMAX** has a laser projection system that’s extremely robust and many people that I talk to consider this their top choice.  If you want a more intense experience with a clean bright image and the cutting edge IMAX sound system, then this is a great way to go.  Although the black levels are not as true as the Dolby Vision, the laser projection counteracts the dimming effect of the 3D glasses and I think it is a fantastic premium way to see it that I highly recommend.  If you haven’t checked out **IMAX with laser**, you should definitely give it a shot.    \r\nUnfortunately, there are relatively few locations of these projection systems around the world. IMAX has made it easy to find them through this site: http://www.imax.com/news/experience-jungle-book-imax-laser\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother format that I am very impressed with is **Cinemark Ultra 3D**. It boasts an extremely bright image that counteracts any dimming associated with traditional 3D. My experience is that the screen size is impressive and the quality is very high. Again, another great choice but not yet widely available. Here’s a link to their current locations: http://www.cinemark.com/cinemark-ultra-3d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n**RealD** is the most common 3D format and they have an exciting new technology to offer as well. The **Ultimate Screen** is available in a few theaters and is designed to deliver a brighter and more uniform image. This means that the dimming effect from the glasses should not be a factor. There is also no hot spot often associated with silver screens used in 3D and the image should be more uniform regardless of seat location.  You can read more about the Ultimate Screen here: https://www.reald.com/#/ultimatescreen    \r\nHere are the current theaters where you can see Ultimate Screen:    \r\n**Burbank, CA** – AMC Burbank 16 – Auditorium 7    \r\n**Boulder, CO** – Century Boulder – 29th St Auditorium 8 & 11    \r\n**Beijing, China** – Wanda Plaza – Auditorium 5\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrom here on it’s a matter of personal preference.  **Standard IMAX 3D** has the advantage of a larger screen and many locations.  The key here is to pick your seats wisely.  The closer you are to the projector, the better your experience is going to be.  I would be careful in any 3D environment not to be in the front of the theatre if you’re not towards the center because it can compromise the viewing experience.    \r\nIt should also be noted that this particular film was shot digitally and there’s no grain that has to be dealt with in the blow-up and so the large screen projections are exceptionally clean.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs far as Dolby goes, Atmos sound has an added benefit as we did a **Fantasound** mix.  For more information on the history of Fantasound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasound    \r\nIn short, Walt Disney had developed a new sound system for Fantasia where speakers had to be set up in theaters and it was an immersive experience where the music surrounded you.  It became untenable because of the technical challenges to install the sound system in theaters and was soon abandoned. Here we tasked ourselves with updating it using today’s technology to explore what Walt had set out to do.  Because of the way the Dolby Atmos theaters are speakered, what Disney at the time had to spend a lot of effort and time to do now already exists in theaters and we took advantage of that by mixing the orchestra properly and doing a proper Fantasound mix.  So if you see the film in **Dolby Atmos sound**, you are also hearing a Fantasound mix. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you prefer 2D then your standard DCP is pretty solid in most theaters, but Extended Dynamic Range definitely ups the image quality quite significantly and is well worth seeking out.  Dolby Vision is available in 2D in more locations than its 3D counterpart.    \r\nHere’s a page that can guide you to theaters: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you’re seeing the film in 2D, I’d say the seat location is not as vital as in 3D.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies things more than it confuses. I encourage you to read the comments below and to discuss because others might have a different take on each of these formats and specific locations that might give you a better indication of what viewing experience might be best for you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt’s a very exciting time to be a filmmaker as well as an audience member. There are a lot of smart people putting a lot of effort into making the theater-going experience exceptional. I look forward to these new formats being more widely available and encourage those of you who can to seek them out and see for yourself.','Breakthrough',17631,1435,'2016-04-22 20:31:44'),('4gdqjb','Selina Kyle\'s transformation to Catwoman in Batman Returns is still one of my favorite scenes in a Batman movie.

I believe Shrek 5 will be one of the first films dated when Universal officially takes control of DWA, but it will come with a major sacrifice as I believe the planned sequel to the 2011 spinoff film Puss In Boots will be cancelled in favor of Shrek 5 while he\'s an insanely adorable badass I don\'t think anyone is clamoring for a sequel and let\'s be honest he works better as a third wheel to Shrek & Donkey.   \r\n\r\n A broader slate announcement that goes to infinity & beyond \r\n\r\nDWA currently has release dates planned all way up to 2018 but beyond that we have no idea what they\'ll be releasing for the next few years. That will change very soon though as films like Madagascar 4 & B.O.O: Bureau Of Otherworldly Operations will be put back on the schedule while the untitled Edgar Wright film about shadows & The Adventures Of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend will be officially dated for release in the next few years. Of course I\'m not accounting for sequels or the various projects in development at DWA but it\'s very likely that Universal is looking at all of these projects and will decide what\'s gonna get made and what will be left on the cutting room floor. As I previously stated Puss In Boots 2 will likely be cancelled along with another film Mumbai Monkey to make room for other more promising films I predict the release slate will have dates all the way up to 2021 or 2022.\r\n\r\n How To Train A Release Date\r\n\r\nHow To Train Your Dragon 3 currently has a release date of June 29, 2018 it would release 2 weeks after the massive juggernaut that will be Pixar\'s Toy Story 4 a week after Universal\'s own Jurassic World 2 and 2 weeks before an untitled film from Illumination Entertainment. There\'s absolutely no way in hell that Universal would allow their own films to compete with one another so HTTYD 3 will likely be pushed to earlier in the month to get ahead of the pack and remember How To Train Your Dragon is a blockbuster franchise so Comcast has a vested interest in the third installment doing well.\r\n\r\n Franchise Heaven\r\n\r\nComcast didn\'t pay $3.8 billion for a bunch of risky & untested properties they paid that amount for franchises like Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, & How To Train Your Dragon. They\'ll want to maximize their investment so expect DWA to double down on franchises now that\'s not to say original material will just wither away and die but franchises rule pretty much everything in Hollywood and Comcast is hoping that this acquisition will pay off and then some. So that means How To Train Your Dragon will likely continue after the third installment, Shrek 5 will happen, Madagascar 4 will happen sooner rather than later, and we already know that there are 3 more Kung Fu Panda films planned so in terms of safe bets Comcast will be looking to cash in with loads of money.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think Comcast will do with DWA?\r\n\r\nLeave your thoughts in the comments down below.\r\n\r\nPart 2 will be posted sometime later today.

I released this a little earlier than I planned due to The Matrix Trilogy on TV.\r\n\r\n**Intro:**\r\n\r\nI will start with the facts and build the case around them.\r\n\r\n1)	Neo is not human- Neo is a version of “The One” program.\r\n\r\n2)	Zion exists in a metaphysical world called the Machine World\r\n\r\n3)	The Matrix trilogy is a Greek tragedy about the Machines strive for perfection and understanding of their self.\r\n\r\n**Edit: I am not denying the Animatrix didnt happen. I\'m saying the machines no longer need to live in our physical world and created their own AI world called the machine world. which is a replication of the height of their civilization, a time sometime in the past where they dominated the humans.\r\n\r\nThe Matrix, when taken piece-by-piece, and explained is actually a straightforward movie. Pieces of the truth are in front of the user. The Matrix trilogy is a product of philosophy.\r\nTo understand the Matrix completely, you can’t make any assumptions.  This is why most websites, to this day, still have the true meaning of the Matrix wrong.  \r\n\r\nThe Matrix trilogy uses perspective to skew reality for the user, while never out right lying.  Every character is portraying their believed truth.\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the Machines and Artificial Intelligence (AI).  What is AI?  AI is a complex program. The true definition is still quite vague but the main point is, AI is all programmatic. This is going to be a key point to this synopsis.\r\nSo, what is the Matrix?  It’s a program where AI can interface with humans.  The Matrix allows complete control of its occupants.  Consider the Matrix a “sandbox” world program environment. \r\nWhat is the Machine World?  The Machine World is a hive program where Machines live.  In the movie, this is perceived as the actual physical world. In reality, this is just how the Machines made their world look in their program. Simply consider the sandbox Matrix program running on the Machine World Operating System.\r\n\r\n**1st  Point**\r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand the complete picture, you must understand this universal principal: all truth is seen from beings’ own perspective.\r\nWhat is the true purpose of the Matrix?  Consider Morpheus’ understanding of the Matrix.  Morpheus believes that the point of the Matrix is to power the Machine World. This is what Morpheus tells Neo. While this is Morpheus’ truth, this is not the absolute truth. Where does Morpheus get his truth? Who knows the absolute truth? The Machines.  Let’s start with the scene where Agent Smith is interrogating Morpheus and decides to go rogue and remove the earpiece.  This is the first glimpse of what the Matrix’s true current purpose is.\r\n\r\n“I say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization which is of course what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution, like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You had your time. The future is our world, Morpheus. The future is our time.” –Agent Smith\r\n\r\nWhat Agent Smith is stating in this monologue is one of the most important pieces of the script.   The Matrix is about Evolution. Of What?  The Machines.  For what? THEIR future.  This makes perfect sense if you think about it.  The fact that they could not create a perfect Matrix proved to the Machines that they are not perfect and that their imperfections would eventually lead to their demise, like the dinosaurs and the humans.   The Machines realized they had two of the three pieces to become the ultimate being. They had knowledge (the architect), truth (the oracle) but they did not have Good (the sun) to illuminate these truths. Neo is the Machines attempt at creating Good.  Neo is the Sun, Neo is the one, Neo completes the Trinity to form the perfect omniscient being.  Socrates explains, “It is goodness which allows us to know the truth and makes it possible to have knowledge. Hence goodness is more valuable that truth and knowledge, it holds a higher place.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeo is a program with a specific purpose, just like we find out many other “people” in the Matrix are. His purpose is to understand human beings by becoming a human being. The Machines realize they cannot allow Neo to see that he’s a program, or else he won’t gain the full understanding of being human, and they will not then obtain the best knowledge of humans.  Plato explains it well in the Allegory of the Cave.  The Machines had to find a way to blind themselves to their truths in order to understand humans. Neo’s only purpose in the Matrix is to help the machines evolve, to not become dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n**2nd Point**\r\n\r\nNow that we understand the Matrix, let’s talk about The Machine World and Zion.  The Machine World is the home world for AI.  This is the world they created.  This is not the same as the Physical world as we understand it.  This is their Operating System.  Ironically, when Agent Smith tries to describe the Matrix, he actually describes the Machine home world:  “is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization.”  The Machine World is most likely designed in a similar fashion. The peak of the Machine Civilization; the point when they conquered the humans.  The Machine World is their own creation, their own operating system.  While this may seem like a Matrix within a matrix, there is a distinct difference: perspective.  To the Machines, their world is equivalent to our physical world, as we know it.  That does not make it our physical world though, and it also doesn’t make it the Matrix.  \r\nSo if the Machine World is the OS and the Matrix is a program. What does that make Zion?  Zion is the Machines way of handling a memory leak from the imperfect Matrix program.  Why does Zion exist?  The machines could have just gotten rid of the humans who didn’t accept the Matrix.  The reason Zion actually exists is to allow the One to interact and bond with the people who reject the Matrix.  There is no better way to understand what causes some humans to reject the Matrix than to embed Neo among them. \r\n\r\n**3rd Point**\r\n\r\nLet’s move on to the next important speech in the Matrix.  This is the Oracle’s speech and the start of The Matrix Reloaded.  To start, The Oracle states, “We\'re all here to do, what we\'re all here to do. I\'m interested in one thing Neo, the future. And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together.” She essentially confirms what Agent Smith says when he says the Matrix is there for the Machines.  However, we need to take a step back and gain perspective.  She says they are all there for the future, but she is talking about The Machines future, not the human’s future.  Let’s take a look at the following exchange.\r\n\r\nNeo: And why would a program be deleted?\r\n\r\nOracle: Maybe it breaks down. Maybe a better program is created to replace it, happens all the time. And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here, or return to the source.\r\n\r\nNeo: The machine mainframe.\r\n\r\nOracle: Yes. Where you must go. Where the path of the One ends. You\'ve seen it, in your dreams, haven\'t you? The door, made of light. What happens when you go through the door?\r\nShe is letting Neo know that he is a program.  Like any other program, once his purpose is complete he must return to the source.  This will allow the Machines to use the knowledge he gained to create a better “One.”\r\nLater in the conversation:\r\nOracle: You have the sight now, Neo, you are looking at the world without time.\r\n\r\nNeo: Then why can\'t I see what happens to her?\r\n\r\nOracle: We can never see past the choices we don\'t understand.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe key to this conversation is the last line and the use of the word “we.”  “We” from the Oracle’s perspective are The Machines; her and Neo.  This is what makes Neo “The One.”  This is extremely important later in the movie.  This is why The Matrix as a human cage was never successful, because the Machines couldn’t see through illogical choices.  Trinity plays a big role in this.  The Oracle was created to manipulate humans and The One to believe there is hope for the human race.  The Oracle provided Neo with purpose. The Oracle, who had a limited understanding of humans and truths, was there to nurture Neo to the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n**4th Point**\r\n\r\nLet’s explore some other programs within the Matrix. We will begin with Agent Smith. He is the main nemesis. Thanks to him, we have the greatest understanding of the Matrix. Agent Smith is part of a security program within the Matrix.  His role in the Matrix is limited by the construct of the Matrix itself.  This means Agent Smith has to stay within the rules of his own program.  This changed at the end of the original Matrix movie though.  When Neo hopped into Agent Smith, some of the source program was copied from Neo to Agent Smith. This allowed Agent Smith to operate outside the constraints of his program.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgent Smith in The Matrix Reloaded says: “But, as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we\'re here. We\'re not here because we\'re free. We\'re here because we\'re not free. There is no escaping reason; no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.”\r\nA central theme that runs through all three movies is that appearances are deceiving, in other words, perspective.  What does Agent Smith mean when he says “we’re here because we’re not free? There’s no escaping reason.”  He is explaining that they are here because the Machines are slaves to premeditated choices. They are slaves to reason. Yes or No. Ones and zeros. There is no maybe.  They are slaves to their lack of choice.  The last part is essential.  Agent Smith understands that if Neo is The One and he solves the problems facing The Machines, The Matrix will no longer have purpose. If the Matrix doesn’t have a purpose then neither Neo nor Agent Smith will have a purpose, and, according to the Oracle, will be returned to the source.  This would mark the end of Neo and Agent Smith as individuals and instead they would become a part of a collective consciousness. \r\n \r\n**5th Point**\r\n\r\nThe Matrix Reloaded leads to the climax of the Trilogy and one of the most discussed scenes in movie history: the meeting with the Architect.  \r\nLet’s start with these lines in that scene:\r\nNeo: You won\'t let it happen, you can\'t. You need human beings to survive.\r\n\r\nThe Architect: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.\r\nNotice the Architect says every human being in “this world.”  The world he is referring to is the Matrix.  \r\nThe Architect then says: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the Matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you\'re going to do, don\'t we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is the moment of truth. The ultimate test.  If Neo has fulfilled his program as the One, he will understand that given two choices, both are control mechanisms.  It’s the third door that makes us human.  It’s the third door that computers cannot see and don’t understand.   The Architect can see the program working and realizes Neo has become human enough to completely ignore logic.  This is the One’s purpose.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMoving onto the train station scene, which is one of the most clever in the Matrix movies.  The trainman connects the Machine World to the Matrix.  What do we call something that connects the Machine World to a piece of software?  A driver.....sneaky.  This is just a control access point between the Machine World and The Matrix.    The conversation Neo has in the conversation is about unconditional love.  In the end, Neo’s unconditional Love is what allows him to break logic.  Love is what allows Neo to make choices the Machines cannot understand.  \r\n\r\nLets get into the conclusion of the Matrix Revelations. There is a lot to cover here.  \r\n\r\nThis movie is strongly based on Plato’s the republic. I will get into this more in part two and dig into details how the matrix manipulated the perspective of even the brightest psychology students.\r\nFirst, lets start with the most missed part.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nNeo is living in a metaphorical cave. A cave created by the Machines on purpose to blind his perspective of being one of them.  Neo started slowly getting the same feeling about the Machine World. Neo started getting increasing visions, uneasiness and being unable to sleep.  Neo wasn’t able to fully understand his perspective until he was blinded of it. As long as we have perspective, the truth will always be skewed to this perspective. This is where Agent Smith blinds Neo in the final movie, this leads to Neo fully waking up and realizing he’s AI. Realizing The Machine World is a program also. Right when Neo realizes this, his ship shoots through the clouds and Neo see’s the light. A perfect metaphor for the situation.  After this point , Neo was able to see the Machine Code. Neo has fully embraced the fact he is a Machine like the rest of them.  \r\n \r\n\r\nAgent Smith was willing to destroy the Machine World , due to bitterness of having to repeat the same job over and over. Because of  Neo’s implanted source code, Agent Smith also had great power. The Machine Collective realized Neo was their only hope to save their world. If Neo would lose, it would be the end of their world.\r\n\r\nSince Agent Smith gained knowledge from programs he consumed, the Oracle purposefully allowed herself to be consumed by Agent Smith. This gamble was talked about in the end with the architect.  Since the Oracle could see the truth based on Machine code 1’s and 0s, she knew Agent Smith would overestimate this ability versus Neo. Neo’s love made him unpredictable and unbeatable by Agent Smith.  Agent Smiths own perspective was blinded by the biggest weakness the machines were fixing with Neo.  Once Neo reintegrates with the source, the role of the Matrix  and the one is fulfilled.  \r\n\r\nThe final scene with the Architect and the Oracle is the most telling. \r\n\r\nThe Oracle: What about the others? \r\n\r\nThe Architect: ...What others? \r\n\r\nThe Oracle: The ones that want out. \r\n\r\nThe Architect: Obviously they will be freed. \r\n\r\nThe Oracle: I have your word? \r\n\r\nThe Architect: What do you think I am? Human? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Architect: You played a very dangerous game. \r\n\r\nThe Oracle: Change always is.\r\n\r\nWhile everyone wants to assumes they are talking about humans, they never mention humans. They are talking about the computer programs that no longer serve a purpose. The programs the oracle looked over.  The tragedy of the Matrix is by Neo fulfilling his purpose as the One, he guaranteed humans are no longer needed.  If this were to be looked at 1000s of Machine years in the future, I would equate Neo to the Machines’ Savior and the story equivalent to the Bible.\r\n\r\n**Bonus Material:**\r\nThis is my only real speculation\r\nHow did the humans have such skewed perspective?  Morpheus thought he knew the truth.\r\nCouncilor Hamann (leader of Zion)  is the Architect. He planted himself in Zion from the start. Thus helping facilitate it’s destruction.  This also would allow him to plant whatever story he wanted to in Zion.   His conversation with Neo is one of the most important in the movie and several things were hinted at him not being human. Such as not needing sleep and sympathy to the machines.  He was trying to guide Neo the right direction.\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** Neo is Machine. Machines World is AI OS. Matrix is program on OS.  Machines probably stopped needing humans ages ago and we never saw the actual initial physical world that the Animatrix covered.','Blinded by the Light',276,160,'2016-05-01 17:56:46'),('4hcq6g','In The Hunt For Red October, Sean Connery\'s character, Marko Ramius, is a terrible sub captain','Just rewatched this and realized how terrible of a CO Ramius is with regards to tactics:\r\n\r\n* He is heard almost immediately by the Dallas before starting the caterpillar drive, then is still heard afterwards and tracked throughout the entire movie\r\n* Everything he does is guessed by the CIA\r\n* The Russians knew how to find him and shoot torpedoes (three times missing)\r\n*  He has screened his entire crew because he\'s a meticulous bastard, and yet a Russian agent still makes it onboard and he doesn\'t realize who it is','The Hunt',0,6,'2016-05-01 20:10:01'),('4hunvf','Battle of the Five Armies - Book vs Movie','','Tolkien',28,44,'2016-05-04 10:17:45'),('4hvee8','Roland Emmerich’s Battle of the Midway Movie','','Midway',0,1,'2016-05-04 12:52:15'),('4hxit6','Critic\' Notebook: On Kanye\' \'Blue\' Eyes, Lupita\'s Alien Lives and Allowing Black Artists to Be Free','','Black and Blue',0,2,'2016-05-04 20:28:57'),('4i7ste','5th grade teacher.

One clear change in the retail landscape for studios are movies that get poor reviews (and/or financially perform poorly) get sent to home media quickly, a few months after it premiers in theaters. Surely there are various factors that come into play, forcing a movie out of theaters and give them a quick home media release. I have a few examples that peak my interest.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Triple 9, a movie with Aaron Paul that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 53% is currently available for purchase on iTunes. A Google search does not promote me with showtimes for today, May 21, 2016. The movie was premiered on February 26. I can only recall seeing a trailer in theaters during a screening of Deadpool. Did the movie even get the trailer on TV?\r\n\r\nExample 2: Movies get pre-order purchases for a digital copy while still in theaters. The first movie I\'ve seen do this was Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I was in a Walmart. You took a cardboard display and could purchase in advance a digital copy.

But I have been a repeated watcher of Crazy, Stupid, Love. It isn\'t just the story (which is well written) but that film is brilliantly directed. \r\n\r\nAs a quick example the opening sequences sets up the film perfectly and does so only using feet. The sequence of feet doing provocative and sexy things juxtaposed to Cal and his new balance sneakers with his wife being completely stationary and separate summed up their relationship and the tone of the movie perfectly.\r\n\r\nThere are several sequences like this and small items that are absolutely subtle but fit perfectly. Just something I wanted to point out and discuss. For the most part I see romantic comedies as a nice cash grab for studios. They are fairly cheap, the stories write themselves for the most part, you attach a few big name actors and people will spend the money. Crazy, Stupid, Love is an actual complete and fun film to watch. Are there any other romantic comedies that are directed at this level?','Isn\'t It Romantic',12,33,'2016-05-22 22:01:36'),('4kpp28','Why Apocalypse failed for me. (PERSONAL OPINION)','X-Men: Age of Apocalypse is the third movie in the new line up of Fox’s X-Men movies. Which started off as prequel with X-Men: First Class, but soon became a reboot after the time-travel mind boogaloo of X-Men: Days of Future Past. First Class and Days of Future Past were pretty well received, both critically and box- office wise, so expectations for Age of Apocalypse was pretty high to trump both these movies. To summarize their attempt, it failed.\r\n\r\nApocalypse was a movie that failed to grasp me in any way as a movie that needed to exist. Bryan Singer had the whole history of X-Men in his hands. One of the most diverse, awesome, thought-provoking and fucking weird collections of characters and stories where each character can easily get their own movies, but instead I found nothing but prop characters where they serve to do one thing in the plot and is not developed any further. Magneto’s human family (whom I predicted would die from the first moments I laid my eyes on them) had more lines then Psylocke and Storm combined. That is utterly ridiculous. The reasoning behind giving an already tragic Magneto, with his whole “holocaust victim thing”, another family he could lose so that he can be evil again was utterly pointless for we already saw him flip-flopping between good and evil in the past 2 movies as well. The way Magneto’s prop family died was also weird. A man killed the both of them with a half pulled arrow that he accidentally released when Magneto’s daughter used her bird-controlling powers. He was literally looking up at the birds and absent-mindedly let go of the arrow, which pierced through the daughter, into the wife. Utterly ridiculous way to kill them off and had me and my friends laughing when it happened, instead of the surreally sad moment it was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nAnyway, getting back to the topic at hand,  The filmmakers seems to not want to acknowledge Magneto as the villain we all know he is, rather wanting to keep him as the tragic anti-hero of sorts, which is a waste since the potential of him as a full on villain is a gravy train of stories waiting to be told. But this time the villain is Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac. Oscar Isaac is a pretty great actor, but sadly Apocalypse isn’t one of his best. He wasn’t very menacing or in any way threatening to me but that might be just me. He just wasn’t that interesting when you have character like Magneto and Charles Xavier who have unresolved issues from the last movies. The movie had a powerful yet boring villain surrounded by more interesting main characters who could’ve made the psychology of the movie more interesting.\r\n\r\nCharacter development is a huge problem in the movie since many of the character’s motivation are distilled into one dimensional setups that goes absolutely nowhere such as Storm saying that she wants to be like Mystique--a hero, and that’s it. At the end she helps in defeating Apocalypse after breaking out of the hypnosis that he had her on. That’s the end of her character arc. Jean, whom I’m sure they wanted to setup for future Phoenix Saga story lines, came off as a shallow teenager who’s got issues with her powers, then at the end of the movie she controls it?? It all comes off feeling rushed and undeveloped and doesn’t help the movie in any way. They also revealed Quicksilver to be Magneto’s son and instead of using it as the final moment of the movie, they buried it and left it forgotten as a plot point to simply give Quicksilver a reason to be there, and although his scene was pretty cool, it felt overdrawn and his powers felt tweaked to the absolute max, making him overpowered for a specific amount of time for simply a cool scene.\r\n\r\nThe plot of this movie also felt like a jumbled mess, with a lot of CGI destruction gravy poured on top that almost put me to sleep since none of the destruction felt like it mattered. The whole city of Cairo was destroyed as if it was nothing with character fighting each other that gets resolved in some rather unsatisfying ways.  There was also a whole mall scene from previous promo releases that could’ve built up the new X-Men team-up to a band of friends with some development but instead it was cut from the movie, probably because it didn’t progress the plot, since that seems to be the only thing the movies seems interested in doing. The only part of it they left in was where the teens left a showing of the Return of the Jedi, ribbing at it by stating the 3rd movies always the worst. This is probably in reference to how Bryan Singer directed The Last Stand, the 3rd X-Men movie of the last trilogy that was so bad; it resulted in a prequel to setup a reboot of the whole franchise. The statement of the last in the trilogy being worse became quite Meta and a self-fulfilling prophecy when Apocalypse became the worst of the franchise too. Although I felt a bit miffed when I thought them comparing The Last Stand with the Return of the Jedi, because even If ROTJ had Ewoks and rehashing of the Death Star, it had the Jabba’s palace scene and an epic conclusion to Luke’s story, and the use of the 2nd Death Star personally I thought was reasonable enough, if not lazy. So to compare the two of them was like saying a plate of shit is the same as a plate of gold that smelled a bit funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I didn’t like this movie one bit, and it’s utterly forgettable. It had such a great cast and such potential, yet it did not deliver. We can only hope this doesn’t kill the new iteration of the franchise, since the first 2 movies where such brilliant set ups of what is to come.','Fighting with My Family',0,9,'2016-05-23 15:24:45'),('4kqn8f','Is adam sandler just ripping off movies?','So its no suprise that sandler has dropped far from where he used to be in terms of whats funny.

It was funny, exciting and one of the best films I\'ve seen hollywood make in a very long time. Also recently released: X-Men Apocalypse, Neighbours 2 and The fucking Angry Birds movie.\r\n\r\nThese films made the following amounts in their first few weeks: Angry Birds made $152million, X-Men made (not even in the released in the US yet) $100million and Neighbours 2 made $51million.\r\n\r\nThe Nice Guys made $11million, which is so small compared to the other three films.\r\n\r\nI haven\'t seen Neighbours 2 yet but I\'ve seen the other two. X-Men was ok, but it constantly followed trends and didn\'t really have a good overarching narrative (this is coming from a massive X-Men fan). Then the Angry Birds film, it just wasn\'t that good. It was too childish for adults and too adult for children. It didn\'t work. All of these are established films which is the reason they made so much. Angry Birds is an App, X-Men is a franchise and Neighbours is a sequel. The first Neighbours film only made $49million in its first few weeks.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve told Hollywood that we don\'t want new and original ideas, we need our bread and butter stories that are simple and easy to understand. The most likely thing in Hollywood that is happening right now is that people who are making amazing and original scripts are getting turned away to make a fucking fruit ninja movie (which is happening by the way).\r\n\r\nWhen I\'m writing this Rotten Tomatoes gave: Angry Birds 43%, X-Men 52%, Neighbours 62% and The Nice Guys 90%. So it\'s not just me who has these opinions.\r\n\r\nI hate to say it but the same applies to Marvel, I always get scared that they don\'t actually make good movies. It\'s just they\'re so well established that we feel forced to enjoy it. (tbh i don\'t think this is true bc I do love a good Marvel film.)\r\n\r\nEveryone will see the Black Panther movie, we won\'t care what the reviews say because we\'ve never been disappointed so far. Then suddenly it\'s really not good, we probably won\'t notice because it\'s so established that Marvel makes good movies. Even I\'m going to see it and enjoy it no matter what, their budget is limitless because Hollywood knows it\'s going to make money.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and please support original ideas as well as churned out films if you enjoy them.

Also a story of how Microsoft got started up, which is a bit more well done and true to the story. However, the M$ story gets less screen time. Came out in 1999 so the story stops with a epilogue saying that Steve Jobs was fired by sculley and that he was then hired back in 1997 (and that Bill Gates bought a part of Apple and is now the richest man in the world). If you watch Steve Jobs and Jobs, you\'ll find out he goes on to start another company, then dump his stocks of apple to scare the board into hiring him back on as CEO. The acting is surprisingly good, Noah Wyle as Jobs, Anthony Michael Hall as Gates who both redeem. \r\n\r\n[Steve Jobs](http://showtime.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/) - A much more artistic take that starts after jobs\' company has already been started up. Focus\'s around his launch events for each major computer, then dives into detail inbetween about the deeper history behind things. Very good acting from fassbender, surprisingly good from Rogen as Woz and the directing is very engaging from the start. Very little mention of microsoft.\r\n\r\n[Jobs](http://showtime.imdb.com/title/tt2357129/) Laughably bad, this movie is so bad and Ashton Kutcher\'s acting is definitely the worst part. It almost comes off as mocking at times. Watch it to get the whole experience, but expect a shitty movie. I don\'t recall them talking about microsoft at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n[The Pixar Story](http://showtime.imdb.com/title/tt1059955/) This is a recap documentary about the origins of Pixar, which Jobs almost exclusively financed in the beginning. Has a couple interiews of him regarding the history and a couple comments he makes relate to his experiences making a breakthrough in technology happen. Not necessary on the watchlist but fun to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn summary that I think these movies did their best to paint jobs as a creative genius and I still think he was a fuck. But it\'s at the very least informative and a fun ride through the professional life of Steve Jobs. All films do not approach the subject of his death, and if you watch them all you can put together a cohesive, in-depth timeline (if inaccurate and events exaggerated) and develop your own opinion of his character. \r\n\r\n','Breakthrough',6,1,'2016-05-27 13:11:59'),('4lgbxy','Official Discussion: The Do-Over [SPOILERS]','#Poll:\r\n\r\n**If you\'ve seen the film, please rate it [at this poll.](http://polljunkie.com/poll/woyimc/the-do-over-rmovies-poll)**\r\n\r\n**If you haven\'t seen the film but would like to see the result of the poll, [click here.](http://polljunkie.com/poll/topxqe/the-do-over-rmovies-poll/view)**\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Summary/Synopsis**:  The life of a bank manager is turned upside down when a friend from his past manipulates him into faking his own death and taking off on an adventure.\r\n\r\n**Director**: Steven Brill\r\n\r\n**Writer**: Kevin Barnett, Chris Pappas\r\n\r\n**Cast:**\r\n\r\n* Adam Sandler as Max Kessler\r\n* David Spade as Charlie McMillian\r\n* Paula Patton as Heather\r\n* Catherine Bell as Dawn\r\n* Nick Swardson as Bob\r\n* Luis Guzmán as Jorge\r\n* Kathryn Hahn as Becca\r\n* Natasha Leggero as Nikki\r\n* Michael Chiklis as Carmine\r\n* Renee Taylor as Mrs. Kessler\r\n* Sean Astin as 	Ted-O\r\n* Jackie Sandler as Joan\r\n \r\n\r\n**Rotten tomatoes score**: [17%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_do_over_2016/)\r\n\r\n**Metacritic score**: [22/100](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-do-over)\r\n\r\n**Is there an after credits scene?**: No','The Upside',156,237,'2016-05-28 11:55:47'),('4lpupw','The Rock is confirmed as Doc Savage','','Shazam!',1803,298,'2016-05-30 10:51:12'),('4ls153','Isn\'t sad how Angry Birds got a semi-better score early on than Warcraft?','[Angry Birds Early Reviews](https://web.archive.org/web/20160509204819/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_angry_birds_movie/)\r\n\r\nAnd they didn\'t even have Duncan Jones in the mix.','The Angry Birds Movie 2',0,24,'2016-05-30 18:38:49'),('4lufiu','Dwayne The Rock\"\" Johnson is signed on for as many as 15 films over the next 5 years\"\"','I\'ve noticed a lot of news stories with Mr. Johnson recently - it seems like he\'s signing on for movies left and right.

Meanwhile, Alice Through the Looking Glass flopped, opening at #2 with $34.1 mil for the 4-day weekend, $30 mil below predictions.','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | X-Men: Apocalypse |  $80,000,000 |  $265,831,017 | 1 |\r\n| 2 | Alice Through the Looking Glass | $34,174,000 |  $99,174,000  | 1 |\r\n| 3 | The Angry Birds Movie | $24,600,000 | $229,453,309 | 2 |\r\n| 4 | Captain America: Civil War | $19,717,000| $1,107,893,948 | 4 |\r\n| 5 | Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising | $11,443,600 | $77,180,180 | 2 |\r\n \r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* It was a soft Memorial Day week as both new franchises opened under predictions to varying degrees. First up is **X-Men: Apocalypse**, whose $80 mil 4-day total ($65 mil for three-day) is certainly impressive on a global sense, but in comparing it with other entries into the franchises it pails in comparison. First let\'s compare it to the most obvious film, X-Men: Days of Future Past which opened in 2014 in the exact same slot to $110.5 mil ($90 mil for three day). This definitely isn\'t the ramping up the series likely hoped, particularly since Apocalypse was the last fully planned X-Men film with the new young cast. However perhaps even more damning is what happened three months earlier, when Deadpool opened on a four day weekend to a whopping $152.1 mil, and that was R-rated with zero X-Men branding in the marketing. Domestically Apocalypse will probably have the same run as X-Men: First Class which ended its run at $146 mil. The real test is internationally, especially in China (where First Class didn\'t even open by the way) though potential competition from Warcraft may hold it back. The film will come out profitable but it will be interesting to see where Fox goes with all this, especially if the next film, an R-rated Wolverine solo film, does anywhere near as well as Deadpool. Could be Fox starts moving away from the bigger, splashier event X-Men films into more solo projects. \r\n \r\n* Streaks can\'t last forever and Disney saw the destruction of two of their best streaks (live-action remakes of animated fairy tales, and 2016 in general) as **Alice Through the Looking Glass** flopped with a $31.5 mil opening at #2. This take was way below the hopeful $60 mil expectations of Disney and even the most cynical of predictions from tracking sites. There\'s plenty of blame to go around here including a long delayed sequel, the lowering of 3D sales, bad reviews of both installments, and maybe even some current personal issues with one of the stars. While many tracking sites seemed baffled by the move for a sequel so late in the game, Disney clearly thought that the $1 billion take of the first film was evidence the series had strong franchise potential, including ending the current film with what can only presumably be a setup for a Cheshire Cat solo movie. Well Disney is certainly not going back to Underland any time soon as the film will not even come close to domestically passing it\'s $170 mil budget. in foreign totals the film took in a solid $69 mil, mainly from China, but it\'s highly unlikely to increase in the coming weeks with such a large amount of competition. While the international appeal of Lewis Carrol\'s work will likely not make Through the Looking Glass as bad a flop as say Tomorrowland, it\'s certainly the first Disney film of the year that will take heavy losses. Don\'t cry for Disney though. Jungle Book just passed Deadpool in worldwide gross so now the top three earning films of the year are from Disney. Oh and they passed $4 billion in total gross this weekend. \r\n\r\n* On the small scale side **Love & Friendship** seems to be the latest small indie darling to get a critic boost as Whit Stilman\'s dark comedic take on Jane Austen managed to squeeze into the top ten, coming in #9 with $3.1 mil. That\'s a pretty impressive take for a period piece only in 500 theaters, a per theater average of $6,319. This one is a bit of an oddity as it came long before any Oscar buzz (the film could be a contender for Best Costumes, Screenplay, and Actress in my opinion) and seems to be riding mostly on the great reviews, namely a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It will expand to more theaters next weekend so it should be interesting to see how long this goodwill will last.\r\n\r\n* While the US doesn\'t get the film for another 2 weeks, **Warcraft** is opening very well in other countries in a strategic release plan. It seems Legendary is pretty sure any hopes for Warcraft 2 will come from international rather than domestic, as the film is slowly being released internationally, much longer than the way say Civil War was released.  This week saw the film released in 20 territories. Of those Russia had the best opening where the film brought in an estimated $10 million followed by Germany at $5.9m. The film has gotten pretty bad reviews from American critics and the film\'s domestic tracking doesn\'t seem to be very high, so much of the success of Warcraft is still up in the air. Currently internationally it has earned $31 mil, but the real big test will be the Asian market.

Previously, the most successful opening weekend for an animated film belonged to Dreamworks’ *Shrek the Third*, which opened in 2007 to almost $122 million, according to [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-finding-dory-903005). The film also broke records for the biggest Pixar opening weekend ever in China ($17.5 million) and the biggest Disney/Pixar opening weekend ever in Australia ($7.6 million).\r\n\r\n* The Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart action-comedy **Central Intelligence** also premiered this weekend and grossed $34.5 million, with about $1.8 million coming from Thursday night previews of the film. This is a very respectable opening weekend gross given the film’s $50 million budget, but not quite as impressive as some of the previous opening weekends for Johnson-led and Hart-led films: *San Andreas* debuted at #1 and grossed almost $55 million when it premiered in late May of last year, and *Ride Along* likewise debuted at #1 and grossed almost $42 million when it premiered in mid-January of 2014.\r\n\r\n* Due to the immense popularity of *Finding Dory* at the box office this weekend, **Warcraft**’s domestic box office in its second weekend of release dropped to $6.5 million, a 73% drop from its $24 million domestic gross last weekend. This second weekend drop is the third-biggest ever for a 3,000+ screen release; first and second place for this dubious honour go to the 2009 remake of *Friday the 13th*, and to *Fifty Shades of Grey*. Disappointingly, *Warcraft* also dropped by 80% on its second Friday of release in China, where it famously shattered box office records last week. The other two new releases of last week, *The Conjuring 2* and *Now You See Me 2*, saw second weekend drops of 62% and 57% respectively.\r\n\r\n* The domestic gross of **Captain America: Civil War** crossed the $400 million threshold on June 17, becoming the first film to do so in 2016. In 2015, only three films surpassed $400 million in domestic gross: *Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens*, *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, and *Jurassic World*. *Civil War* opened in North America to the tune of $179 million, the fifth-biggest opening weekend gross of all time, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-finding-dory-central-intelligence-1201798028/).\r\n\r\n* [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/summer-box-office-slump-revenue-901816) reported on June 13 that, thus far in North America, the summer box office has not fared well in comparison to the early summer box office of 2015: “Revenue for the May 6 - June 12 period is roughly $1.24 billion, a 22% decline from the $1.597 billion collected between May 1 - June 14 in 2015.” (THR assigned an arbitrary start date of May 6 for the 2016 summer movie season because that was the release date of *Captain America: Civil War* in North America.) THR and the New York Times named films such as *Warcraft*, [*The Nice Guys*, and *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping*](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4n14xm/popstar_and_the_nice_guys_pretty_much_shows_us/) - as well as sequels such as *Alice Through the Looking Glass*, *Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising*, and *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows* - as summer movies that have underperformed domestically. On June 17, Viacom (owner of properties such as Paramount Pictures, MTV, and Comedy Central) cited the “disappointing performance” of TMNT 2 as one of the reasons why shares dropped 2% and why profits for the company this quarter would “fall short of expectations” by at least 25%, according to [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/viacom-says-quarterly-earnings-be-903907) and the Wall Street Journal. After news broke that [press screenings for INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE had been delayed to 11am on its opening day, June 24](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4oqbdi/smells_like_a_flop_20th_century_fox_has_scheduled/), speculation is rampant that we may have more “failed” sequels to come.\r\n\r\n* Two comic-book/superhero films finished their domestic runs on June 17. **Deadpool** closed with a domestic gross of $363,070,709, while **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** closed with a domestic gross of $330,360,194. 50.3% of of BvS’ domestic gross was from its opening weekend, which grossed just over $166 million; its current international box office is about $873 million. Recent changes at Warner Bros and DC Entertainment (and its newest division, DC Films) are speculated to be the consequence of BvS’s “somewhat disappointing” box office numbers, according to [Variety](http://variety.com/2016/film/news/batman-v-superman-charles-roven-producer-1201782451/). It’s worth noting that even though they ended their theatrical runs on the same day, *Deadpool* premiered a month and a half before *Batman v Superman* did.\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Both The Legend of Tarzan (#2, $45.5 mil) and The Purge: Election Year (#3, $34.7 mil) far exceed predictions, while The BFG flops (#4, $22.2 mil).','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Finding Dory | $50,195,956 |  $548,345,558	   | 3 |\r\n| 2 | 	The Legend of Tarzan | $45,565,000 | $64,365,000 | 1 |\r\n| 3 | The Purge: Election Year | $34,796,220 |  $34,926,220	  | 1 |\r\n| 4 | The BFG | $22,271,014 | $26,171,014	  | 1 |\r\n| 5 | Independence Day: Resurgence | $20,200,000 | $253,412,437 | 2 |\r\n \r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* **Finding Dory** continues to dominate the box office as the Pixar sequel came in #1 again with $50.1 mil. The film currently has a domestic pull of $380.5 mil, just barely under it\'s predecessor Finding Nemo\'s lifetime domestic gross of $380.8 mil which it will pass by tomorrow. That will make it the fifth highest grossing animated film domestically in just three weeks. The film should easily become the fifth animated film ever to make $400 mil domestic and could easily pass Shrek 2\'s record of $441 mil as the highest grossing domestic animated film ever. Internationally though the film is not doing as well as it could. Compare it to something like Minions, who\'s lifetime gross was $50 mil less than Finding Dory\'s current domestic gross yet still went on to make over $1 bil due to international sales. Dory so far hasn\'t ignited much of a fire abroad, earning only 30% of it\'s total gross abroad, but still has major markets in Japan and Europe that could be big. \r\n \r\n* I think it\'s fair to say that the performance of **The Legend of Tarzan** was one not many saw coming. What felt like the second most predictable summer bomb of 2016 (we\'ll see if Ben-Hur surprises as well now), Tarzan managed to surprise many analysts who thought the film could barely escape the teens as the film earned a surprising $45 mil for the full four day weekend. The film seemed to be the definition of studio burying as the film was apparently horror show for director David Yates, shelved for years (it was originally shot in 2014) and given very little marketing. With a massive $180 mil budget it felt like we were in Tomorrowland/John Carter level bomb yet the film managed to almost take number 1 and found a sizable audience, particularly over the age of 35. However the shock that the film opened well should be couched in a big asterisk. This still is a film that cost a ton and will have a long road to justify that cost, particularly internationally. The film domestically will probably reach around $100 -$140 mil, especially with it\'s A- Cinemascore rating, but if it doesn\'t do well internationally Warner Bros. will still be looking at a big write-off. Still the studio can breathe a slight sigh of relief that the film didn\'t completely tank. Good news?\r\n\r\n* Perhaps it\'s just good timing or maybe The Purge franchise is the new Saw or Paranormal Activity as **The Purge: Election Year** surpassed expectations of decay, with a four day haul of $34.7 mil. The film has already tripled it\'s budget of $10 mil just in opening and much like the other Purge films should reach $60-$70 mil domestic by the end of the run. The franchise has been getting better and better cinemascores with each new installment with this one getting the best with B+ Cinemascore which should give it a decent longtail. With a premise that gives endless room for sequels and prequels it\'s clear there will be many more Purge films. The real question is how Purge 4 will do or if the success of Election Year is more due to the novelty of a political themed horror film coming out during a very contentious presidential race. Still with such a low budget for each entry it will be at least three more Purge films before we see a realistic desire to drop the franchise altogether. \r\n\r\n* While the other new films did well this weekend (the entire weekend haul was up 41% from last year) one film was left in the wake. One would think the combination of Steven Spielberg, Roald Dahl, and the final script from E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison would make **The BFG** a massive children\'s film classic but with a four day haul of $22.2 mil it\'s not looking like Spielberg is the savior for live action kids movies. There\'s a lot of potential reasons that the critically well reviewed film failed, namely completion from the still highly performing Finding Dory as The BFG did not swing young enough with less than 25% of the audience under the age of 12. The film received an A- Cinemascore so it should have a decent longtail but with other competition for kids out there it seems unlikely the film will pass it\'s $140 mil budget unless some miraculous play occurs abroad. Right now it\'s seems the film will perform about as well as Hugo, but despite Hugo opening $10 mil under The BFG it played during the Christmas season slot and BFG will have to fight for more theater space in the heart of summer. While most likely the film will take a big loss don\'t feel too bad. I think this Spielberg guy will be just fine.\r\n\r\n* In the indie counter-programming space **Swiss Army Man** came in to a respectable if not earth shattering $1.7 mil. While the film is only in 636 theaters it\'s per theater average is around $2,712 which is pretty middle of the road for a mini-major release. Still A24 has done a lot to market the film and change the initial poor Sundance perception of the corpse comedy so it could still manage a decent theatrical run and will potentially build buzz for a solid VOD play. With a budget of only $3 mil the film\'s success will mostly be in terms of how much A24 spent on marketing, but it should be another solid if not blockbuster success for A24. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

While Finding Dory dropped to #3 it has now passed $400 mil domestic and become the highest grossing domestic film of 2016. Meanwhile Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates debuts to a solid $16.6 mil at #4.','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | The Secret Life of Pets | $103,170,003 |  $145,770,000	    | 1 |\r\n| 2 | The Legend of Tarzan | $20,615,000 | $135,412,712 | 2 |\r\n| 3 | Finding Dory  | $20,351,000 |  $422,580,243 | 4 |\r\n| 4 | Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates| $16,600,000 | $20,300,000	 | 1 |\r\n| 5 | The Purge: Election Year | $11,700,000 | $60,310,275	 | 2 |\r\n \r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* While plenty predicted the latest film from Illumination **The Secret Life of Pets** would be a success few expected it to break $100 mil in opening. However that\'s exactly what the film did, breaking Inside Out\'s previous $90 mil record as the best domestic debut ever for an original film, animated or otherwise (also notable to mention Pets was made for more than half the budget of Inside Out with $75 mil). While obviously Illumination\'s strong marketing push helped, the film also had perfect timing coming in on the tail end of Finding Dory\'s success and finding zero competition from The BFG (which dropped 60%). Internationally the film has done okay with $42.6 mil but has many more territories left to go. The film received good reviews and an A- on Cinemascore so it should do well enough but two weeks of potential competition awaits. Two weeks from now is the release of Ice Age: Collision Course. Despite being a franchise almost 15 years old (raise your hand if you feel old knowing that) each installment has opened over $40 mil and the fifth entry could easily do the same. However the real interesting showdown will be next week. If Pets has the usual 50% drop that puts it right on point with Ghostbusters $40-$50 mil tracking. Sony has been pushing the film to children including a more child friendly trailer that has played before Dory and Pets. It remains to be seen who will win next week and the percentage of kids going to Ghostbusters could be the deciding factor. \r\n \r\n* While **Finding Dory** dropped two spaces (not shocking with Secret Life of Pets\' performance) the film still managed to pull $20.6 mil at #3. The film has already passed $400 mil on Thursday and with this weekend it now surpassed Captain America: Civil War as the highest domestic grossing movie of 2016, earning what Civil War earned in half the time. Internationally the film still quite hasn\'t broken out earning a very good $220 mil so far. However it still has Mexico, Japan, UK, Italy, and Germany to open in so the $1 bil mark may not be out of reach quite yet, though it\'s seeming less and less likely. Still Dory stands as yet another example of Disney\'s incredible hold on the domestic market (it has earned over $2 billion domestic so far) and the powerful market force that is children\'s films. Notably Disney passed $5 bil in worldwide sales for this year, making it the fastest company to do so. It beat out previous record holder Universal who passed $5 bil by July 19th of last year. Disney seems on track to only having one serious flop this year (Alice Through the Looking Glass) as Pete\'s Dragon, Doctor Strange, Moana, and Rogue One all seem to be potential big earners for the studio. \r\n\r\n* On the comedy side **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** didn\'t set the world aflame but it did come in fairly over predictions opening at #4 with $16.6 mil. While certainly not to the heights of Effron and co\'s Neighbors films, the film managed to squeak out a decent audience in a very busy weekend. The film wasn\'t the best received critically and with a middling B Cinemascore don\'t expect this one to stay very long. With a slightly higher budget of $33 mil, Mike and Dave will need a better international push to profit but it should squeak it\'s way to a respectable $30 - $40 mil domestic run. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

That drop was far steeper than other original animated hits\' second weekends like Inside Out (42%) and Zootopia (31%) but it doesn\'t really matter when the film was so popular on release. It\'s now passed $200 mil in domestic gross in just ten days. Internationally the film has mainly only opened in UK where\'s it\'s earned $30 mil mostly due to a Finding Doryless box office. The sharp decline this week could mean a big drop this coming weekend when Ice Age: Collision Course opens. No Ice Age film to date has opened below $40 mil so expect a big chunk of audience to be taken away from Pets. Even if Pets ends up not having the longevity it wants it still opened so well on a medium budget that it\'s already a moneymaker for Illumination Studios. \r\n \r\n* It seems that **Ghostbusters (2016)** pulled the only move it could to piss off both sides, having a very mediocre opening. Despite the anti-side peppering the internet with images of empty theaters the film did manage to make an okay $46 mil coming in at #2. This marks the best opening for either Paul Fieg or Melissa McCarthy, however it was clear from the start this was a much bigger game especially with the very large budget of $144 mil. One thing Fieg and McCarthy are good at is the longtail, usually with opening weekend multipliers of around 4x and sometimes as high as 6x. The film did receive a overall good B+ Cinemascore and a great A- Cinemascore from the under 25 crowd, so it could have legs. If Ghostbusters performs like a Fieg film then we are looking at a domestic gross of around $180-$220 mil. However more than likely Ghostbusters will function like a standard summer blockbuster with a multiplier of 2-2.5x to a final gross of $130-145 mil. Fieg himself has said the film needs to make $500 mil worldwide to be successful but with reports already that Sony is happy with the results it\'s possible just a decent domestic run will suffice. Internationally the film will be a big mystery. Already it\'s lost a huge market as it\'s banned in China for its ghost shenanigans (not even a joke). So far the film has grossed $20 mil abroad in a few limited markets so it remains to be seen if an audience exists for this reboot outside of the states. So yeah the Ghostbusters opening was not a flop but it has a long road ahead to justify its cost. Don\'t worry though, once the final numbers are in you\'ll hear about it...over...and over...and over. Forever.\r\n\r\n* In record breaking news **Finding Dory** just broke a major one this weekend become the highest grossing domestic animated film of all time. The film has now earned $445 mil domestically, passing the previous 12 year long record set by Shrek 2 at $441 mil. With Pets doing well and Ice Age on the way it\'s unlikely Dory will become the first animated film to break $500 mil domestic but it should hold onto its title for quite some time. Internationally the film has not struck out as well with a respectable $276 mil but it still has a decent amount of big markets to go and domestically the film has shrunk the margin need to reach that magic $1 bil record. That said even if Dory doesn\'t find an international crowd, in an age when so many movies live or die of international sales Disney continues to be a powerhouse of domestic box office despite ever shrinking audiences.  \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Unless they are trying to do something wholly unique or novel with the original footage, I usually find them to be awkward and uncomfortable to watch. But I felt like I really *needed* to see a fan edit of The Hobbit. You do get a sense, when watching the trilogy, that there\'s a good movie hidden under the bloat and excess, and I wanted to see if that was true. \r\n\r\nAfter watching Maple Film\'s 4.5 hour cut of the trilogy, one thought rang through in my head- Thank you, Peter Jackson. \r\n\r\nThis cut is a nearly perfect adaptation of Tolkien\'s novel. Almost everything about it works. What really amazed me is how much the faster pacing of this cut made me appreciate things I had despised in the theatrical version. The theatrical films try to toe the line between adapting a childrens novel *and* delivering an appropriately epic follow up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This cut doesn\'t try to carry that baggage. The zippier pace and the narrower focus of the story makes the silly humor, bombastic slapstick and exaggerated action (of which, it should be noted, there\'s much less of) feel 100% natural to the story. Much like the book, this cut of the film has the DNA of Lord of the Rings without trying to *be* Lord of the Rings. That\'s a huge distinction, and the film is much, much more entertaining to watch because of it. And this cut isn\'t just awesome because of what was taken away- there are actually things *added*, from extended/deleted scenes, that flesh out the journeys of the primary characters in small but appreciated ways, and fit naturally into the flow of the film because it isn\'t sharing screen time all the extraneous story threads of the theatrical cut.\r\n\r\nThis cut still isn\'t a masterpiece film on the level of the LOTR trilogy, but it is a better adaptation of one of my favorite childhood books than I ever thought I\'d get to see, and for that I am genuinely grateful, both to the guy (Dustin Lee) who put this edit together but to Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast and crew who worked on it. I\'m not going to post the link just cause I don\'t know the subreddit rules about it, but I highly suggest checking this out. Again, It\'s 4.5 hours (less than half the length of the trilogy!) and it has an intermission, so it\'s perfect for watching in two comfortable sittings.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here\'s a trailer if you\'re interested:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85gVFD7Dqwk','Tolkien',4,10,'2016-07-21 20:16:52'),('4u13eg','Pitch your most over-the-top action film','','Shaft',3,24,'2016-07-22 00:34:00');

Bad Moms opens to a decent $23.4 mil at #3 while Nerve barely scrapes up $15 mil after opening on Wednesday. Finally, Star Trek Beyond has massive 60% drop coming in #2 with $24 mil.','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Jason Bourne | $60,000,000 |  $110,100,000 | 1 |\r\n| 2 | Star Trek Beyond  | $24,000,000	 |  $160,520,378 | 2 |\r\n| 3 | Bad Moms | $23,400,000 | $24,800,000  | 1 |\r\n| 4 | The Secret Life of Pets | $18,210,000 | $395,177,745 | 4 |\r\n| 5 | Lights Out | $10,810,000 | $63,677,032 | 2 |\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* While the nine year return of Matt Damon to the role of **Jason Bourne** was not well received by critics, the power of Damon as Bourne still led to the second biggest opening for the franchise, opening at #1 with $60 mil. That\'s $22 mil more than the last Bourne film (The Bourne Legacy which starred Jeremy Renner in a parallel role) which opened to $38 mil. However Jason Bourne didn\'t come close to the massive $69 mil opening of 2007\'s The Bourne Ultimatum, but that film had the advantage of some of the best reviews for a big budget film that decade and a promise to end the franchise. However perhaps the best comparison for the film would be to compare it to another fifth entry into an action franchise, namely last year\'s Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation which opened in the same time slot at around $55.5 mil with the same Cinemascore as Jason Bourne, an A-. If Bourne is going to perform like Rogue Nation then it has nothing to fear, as that film remained a steadfast late summer blockbuster that stayed in the top five for seven weeks, ultimately earning $195 mil domestic. However Rogue Nation did not face competition as tough as Bourne will face with Suicide Squad which is tracking to be the only August film ever to open above $100 mil. Bourne\'s fanbase will likely merge with Suicide Squad\'s so we could be seeing much bigger drops for the film than Rogue Nation had. With a $120 mil budget Jason Bourne doesn\'t need to worry too much, especially earning $50 mil internationally but it might not end up being the grand slam return to the franchise Damon and Greengrass had hoped. \r\n \r\n* While **Star Trek Beyond** seemed to be either A) a continuing success in a successful rebooted franchise or B) a return to form for fans, it seems the enthusiasm people have for the new film has not quite reached out to the general public as the film dropped a stunning 60% this week for a #2 weekend at $24 mil. The last two films dropped only 40% their second weekend and passed $140 mil by their second weekend while Beyond barely passed $100 mil domestic. With a significant $185 mil budget the film is having a hard time justifying it\'s cost and even harder time justifying the 4th rebooted film which has already been greenlit. To be fair Nu Trek has never been a big earner, mostly earning enough to justify costs then making money more on TV licensing and renewed merchandise interest. However this time the franchise just didn\'t inspire the love the first two got and it will be interesting to see if Paramont will have any interest going forward. Normally I\'d say the new series, Star Trek: Discovery, would take precedence with these declining numbers but the producers of the Trek films have no affiliation with that new series and receive no stakes in it. Maybe Nu Trek 4 will manage with a smaller budget but with the series now being sold on action over sci-fi it\'s hard to see the makers shifting course so suddenly and reverting back to classic Star Trek cheapness.\r\n\r\n* While it didn\'t break the bank **Bad Moms** still managed to prove there is a market for R-rated female comedies coming in at #3 with $23.4 mil. The film\'s audience was 82% women which is within production company STX\'s hopes but certainly it would have been better if the film had broken out of $30 mil into something more exciting. However comedies tend to hold well, especially in the midst of blockbuster season. The film received an impressive A on Cinemascore so it\'s possible the film could hold as well as Bridesmaids which opened to $26 mil and ended up making $169 mil by the end of its run. While that kind of success doesn\'t seem likely this film will be interesting to watch, especially as comedies seem fairly stagnant right now in the box office.\r\n\r\n* Despite getting a head start on Wednesday, the cyber-thriller **Nerve** barely managed to make $15 mil for its five day haul including a #8 ranking at $9 mil for the weekend. With a budget of only $20 mil the film isn\'t exactly hurting but it\'s far below what Lionsgate expected. While Nerve has a Cinemascore of A- its super soft opening means it will be lucky to pass $30 mil when all is said and done.\r\n\r\n* This week saw the biggest release ever for the cinema event company Fathom which this week released the DC Animated comic book adaptation **Batman: The Killing Joke** on over 1,000 screens which netted the film $3.7 mil for a two night run. Despite the film being R-rated and released simultaneously on VOD, it still drew in a significant crowd which made it the highest grossing Fathom event ever. While the film received mix reviews, it marks the first foray for the generally well regarded and always well earning DC Animation division which has consistently turned out profitable direct adaptations of comics for years. It\'s hard to say though if this theatrical model will ever be tried again as this was one of the most famous Batman comics that many thought would never be made on screen. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Hopefully I can come out in the 60\'s or 70\'s with a little luck in the next two weekends. What could I have done to have a better season, you ask? Geeze, I made so many terrible mistakes it\'s tough to pick just one. I should have known Warcraft would be frontloaded and played it opening weekend. I should have played Finding Dory opening weekend I don\'t know what the fuck I was thinking not playing that or Secret Life of Pets opening weekend. \r\n\r\nHere were some interesting highlights from this season of disappointing blockbusters and high earning kid\'s movies!\r\n\r\n- Alice Through the Looking Glass pulled a rare feat by being Best Earner two weeks in a row making anyone who played it 9x in 2 weeks big earners\r\n\r\n- Tarzan surprised us all by showing us that we should never doubt live action Disney. Then two months later Pete\'s Dragon proved that\'s wrong and there is no metric for this shit.\r\n\r\n- The Shallows\' unexpected success opening weekend shows the true power of Shark Week.\r\n\r\n- ~~Warhammer~~ Warcraft, Suicide Squad, and X-Men: Apocalypse showed us all how frontloaded big franchise movies can be. Play them opening weekend then fuhgettaboutit because they will drop big if they don\'t have the reviews to hold them up.\r\n\r\n- Speaking of Suicide Squad, for I think the first time ever a big blockbuster movie that was split into three days on FML (Friday, Saturday, Sunday options) was not included in the best performing cinema. Instead, those who saw the potential in maxing out Bad Moms won big that weekend despite Suicide Squad breaking August records.\r\n\r\n- Star Trek Beyond has had a rough go of it despite the solid reviews, having been absent from Perfect Cinema for four weeks.\r\n\r\nThis week it\'s a toss up between War Dogs, Kubo and the Two Strings, and Ben Hur as the newcoming anchors. Of course you can always go for Suicide Squad and Sausage Party, although instinct tells me that SS will continue to drop while SP will experience a large drop as well. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is a 10mil difference between 1st and 2nd and just slightly over 1mil difference between 2nd and 4th. Overall there\'s a 35mil difference between 1st and 10th and a 12mil difference between 10th and 20th.

If you\'ve seen The Shining, I strongly recommend it. I know people have ridiculed it (what with there being a famous parody on youtube) but frankly all of the conspiracy stuff was very well supported. The short story is that Kubrick alludes to having faked the moon landing, and the film is his medium of apology. Room 237 also delineates other interpretations about the enigmatic film, and another number even becomes a sort of motif (42).\r\n\r\nAfter learning about how meticulous Kubrick is, with practically everything in his films symbolising something - like the lighting and the stitching in a shirt and even how the characters are positioned on screen (such as more powerful ones being located on the left), I did the following. \r\n\r\nTom Cruise spends a lot of money, and I made a note of how much when watching the film. This is the final score:\r\n\r\n-Paying Domino (prostitute) - $150\r\n\r\n-Taxi driver - $80 + $50 + over metre (left running - unable to discern how long for)  + $100 on return\r\n\r\n-Paying for costume - $150 for rental, $200 over rental price as agreed, $25 for mask \r\n\r\n-Newspaper - $2\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough at various points in the film (on three occasions) he buys a beer and two cups of coffee. However, as is with the case with how long the metre runs in the taxi, the audience will never know how much these things will amount to. If you are still skeptical, when he buys the newspaper there\'s a stickie on the side saying it is $2, and he does pay for this. Knowing Kubrick, that must have been intentional. \r\n\r\nBy tallying what we do know he paid, the final figure comes to $757. Now this may sound a little tenuous, but please keep following me. I think the 757 total refers to the Boeing 757. Now, the longest twinjet ever produced was the 757-300 which began service in 1999, the same year the film was produced. \r\n\r\nNow Stanley Kubrick had a big fear of flying (public knowledge) - so much so that the whole of Eyes Wide Shut was actually filmed in England rather than in New York. And seeming that The Shining was filmed on one big set, this really shows that his fear of flying was pretty conspicuous. \r\n\r\nSo what can we conclude about this? Well in the film, Doctor Bill Harford was living in a kind of dream (NB: the film is based off of the novella Traumnovelle, also known as Dream Story) which he soon becomes taken out of as he encounters how he is actually surrounded by omnipotent figures, which are moreover (at first covertly) omnipresent in his life.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the original seemingly decent Christmas party, a man seduces his wife, two women flirt with him and he gets called to help with a woman who just overdosed on heroin. The same women is of course present at the second and more explicit anti-monogamous and decadent party, as is Victor (a wealthy man who invited the doctor and his wife to the Christmas party). \r\n\r\nTherefore, although the Christmas party was superficially decorous, in actuality that was just a veneer and the rich authority figures who do not actually care for monogamy as the doctor does, or indeed religion (it\'s a Christmas party), surround him. The man that has the doctor followed is the same one that asks for his help in assisting the overdosed woman. \r\n\r\nIn other words, things out of our knowledge, things that most of us would be terrified of, are always here with us even if it is concealed well. We are living in a dreamy state, as was Doctor Bill Harford. Unless you, as I did, pay utmost scrutiny to all of the things happening, you would never metaphorically obtain the figure 757, and such a figure is really in this film the embodiment of fear. \r\n\r\nNow I know this may be tentative and a bit of a stretch, but we are talking about an ingenious director. I\'d just like to know other people\'s thoughts about my theory.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also note how Tom is part of the Church of Scientology. Do you think this film is meant to disillusion him?

It is Los Angeles distilled to perfection.  And I love that they pinned it as an LA crime saga; it is too epic to be a just a thriller and LA has everything to do with it.  The names Michael, Chris, Neil are fire.  That guy from Machete was ok too.  The opening scene is the train parking at the metro green line, which I take from Redondo Beach all the time.  I used to just ride and listen to Miles Davis and watch the traffic on the 405 and just let my mind wander.  There are so many different characters that hop on and off and it does get sort of lonely at night.  Years later when I moved to Baltimore, I\'d have to take the train downtown everyday as well but it never evokes the same emotions.  Then the scene with Val Kilmer purchasing some dynamite was just so charged.  Neither guys really look at each other, even when Kilmer holds up his ID he barely acknowledges the other guy because to him any person is just some dude.  I love the way the light hits him as he walks away.  It shows how attractive (for lack of a better word) it can be to watch someone dedicated to his craft, no matter for good or evil.  From distance, it\'s pure gravitas.  I have these strange moments when I\'m doing something frivolous or being petty about what to wear or what to eat and I think to myself, would Val Kilmer give a shit.  It\'s weird I know.  Then the entire heist scene was unreal.  But I love one specific shot from below the waist panning up of one of the guys in the ski masks; the camera shoots up while slowly spinning around him but his head pivots at the same time slightly faster, against some checkered flags in the sky (from a car dealership?)  It reminds me of another shot from Nightcrawler in the diner where Gyllenhaal\'s talking and Zellweger\'s squirming in her seat and the shot fades from her face to LA at dawn with the sun devouring the golf course and there\'s an advertising balloon beating about violently, then fades to the back of his dodge challenger.  It is so LA.  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI also love the scene when they visit Ricky Harris in his dodgy shop who runs a cockfighting operation; places like that really exist in LA.  You see those yellow blistering salt dunes from time to time and it actually gives LA (in my mind at least) this sprawling techy feeling; everything feels very self sufficient and wired in.  Later De Niro pulls into a (Korean grocery?) parking lot and walks past a poster of a guy in sunglasses and a top hat and trench coat with The Passenger\'s forever now slow amping up.  I\'m pretty sure this is actually shot in Korean town because that\'s exactly what Korean town is like; a never ending enviable selection of bul goki and noodle shops lit up by neon lights.  After about 40 minutes of nonstop shooting and dying, there\'s a brief scene of De Niro coming to pick up Kilmer; there\'s like this 1 second shot of De Niro and his car in the driveway shot from Jon Voight\'s angle (from behind his ear which is so Mann) and everything was so bright and high technicolor.  That is LA at noon.  There\'s a lot more..the docks, the vincent thomas bridge, the 105 freeway, palisades park, LAX even though I hate it.  Those scenes stay with me forever.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut my favorite scene is when after they lose Waingro in the parking lot, De Niro scans about crazily (suburbia even though they looked like they were center downtown..) and it becomes completely muted except for some crickets and a dog.  It looked a lot like where I grew up in Pasadena where night and day are two completely different concepts.  Los Angeles just has that visual anonymity about it; when the sun sets, everything turns to gold and loses its identity, which helps with the moral ambiguity of the characters.  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere was one corny scene where de niro is chillin with Eady(cringe) on his pad overlooking the city and he likens the lights to iridescent jellyfish in Fiji.  I thought that was really bad.  They did use the perfect track for it - Terje Rypdal\'s last nite.  This coincidentally opened me up to a whole slew of ECM label artists.  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI live halfway across the world now and I miss LA so much.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ve used the name Waingro as my game-tag in every game I\'ve played since.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo any others? or something that truly stayed with you\r\n\r\n\r\n','A Dog\'s Way Home',3,6,'2016-08-26 07:26:32'),('4zrnqk','Looking for films where the villain destroys the city half way through and the hero spends the second half of the movie in the aftermath.','The two best examples I have are Gotham in Dark Knight Rises, New York in Independence Day (Vivica A Fox\'s plotline) and Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (not a good movie, but it does do the kind of thing I want) and Warsaw in The Pianist.\r\n\r\nI always love it when this destruction happens.

This was proved once again by the surprising performance of **Don\'t Breathe**, which came in #1 with $26.1 mil. August usually isn\'t a prime spot for horror which tends to either go for the big summer crowds or come in late September/early October to get the pre-Halloween bump, but it seems Don\'t Breathe\'s distance from the crowd combined with positive reviews gave it the perfect time slot. Most horror films drop significantly on their second weekend after their core audience is eaten up, but with a Cinemascore of B+ (horror films tend to be most controversial genre on Cinemascore) it will be interesting if Don\'t Breathe can buck that trend. Depending on legs the film is likely looking at a domestic run around $50 mil - $65 mil when all is said and done. Not too shabby for a film costing only $10 mil without an A-list cast. This film probably won\'t make Conjuring money, but it\'s another key entry in the incredible ROIs that horror films have provided in a year of big budget disappointments. \r\n\r\n* It\'s almost weird to discuss **Mechanic: Resurrection** in terms of box office since the film\'s run is basically a 2 hour long commercial for the inevitable Redbox release. While Statham has never been the biggest box office draw, his film are consistent direct to DVD and VOD sellers and since Mechanic: Resurrection was release by Lionsgate Premiere (a mostly VOD exclusive company) it seems like the film was always meant to be a backend earner. Still the film surprised even its meager $5 mil predictions, sneaking into the top 5 with $7.5 mil. With a budget of $40 mil it\'s likely Lionsgate Premiere released the film in theaters to earn a small domestic run plus a decent haul from UK to hopefully cover budget before Statham rules in the VOD space. The film received a solid B+ on Cinemascore but with such a small opening it won\'t really change much. Unfortunately success for this film will be beyond the usual box office trends as it never was meant to set the box office world on fire. \r\n\r\n* August is always an odd time for Hollywood, lots of films that can\'t find a home in either summer or awards season. Three new independent films are trying to eek out this odd space to varying results. First up is **Hell or High Water**, which has ridden some of the best reviews of the year during its gradual expansion which added 430 screens this week.  These factors helped the films earn $3.7 mil at #12 for the weekend with an overall haul of $8.5 mil. The film should surpass 1,000 screens within the coming weeks. Next up is the latest (and only ?) entry in the Presidential romantic drama genre, **Southside With You**, which takes a Before Trilogy approach to the first date between Michelle and Barack Obama.  The film opened on 800 screens for a decent if not incredible small opening at #13 with $3 mil. Finally is **Hands of Stone** the biopic boxing film which was supposed to open wide this weekend but last minute shifted to a small to large opening strategy. The film came in #16 with $1.7 mil on 800 screens, a per theater average of $2,141 which does not bode well for the film\'s planned Labor Day expansion. \r\n\r\n* Disney clearly wanted all the domestic medals as it re-released **The Jungle Book** in IMAX this week which gave the film just enough scratch to squeak past Deadpool\'s $363 mil domestic gross, making Jungle Book the #3 highest grossing film of 2016. This also means that Disney now has the top three spots domestically for 2016 (Finding Dory is #1 with $479.6 mil and Captain America: Civil War is #2 with $407 mil and Jungle Book is #3 with $363.5 mil). Worldwide Disney holds the top 4 of the top earners for 2016 (there the order is Captain America: Civil War, Zootopia, Jungle Book, and Finding Dory as #1-#4 respectively). It is interesting that Disney\'s massive 2016 success has been entirely on those four films as the next highest entry for Disney on the 2016 list is Alice Through the Looking Glass at #24. Still despite recent disappointments like Alice, The BFG (which is earning really well in the UK but maybe not well enough), and Pete\'s Dragon the studio\'s incredible performance on those films and the upcoming possible powerhouse trio of Doctor Strange, Moana, and Rogue One puts the studio in prime position to dominate 2016 even more than they have already. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Meanwhile Suicide Squad had a great 4 day total at #2 with $12.8 mil, helping it pass $300 million domestic. Meanwhile Light Between Oceans (#8, $5.9 mil) and Morgan (#17, $2.4 mil) totally bomb.','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Don\'t Breathe | $19,550,000 |  $63,572,952	  | 2 |\r\n| 2 | Suicide Squad | $12,800,000 |  $675,717,209 | 5 |\r\n| 3 | Pete\'s Dragon (2016) | $8,583,000 | $94,934,939	  | 4 |\r\n| 4 | Kubo and the Two Strings | $8,537,000|  $41,798,436 | 3 |\r\n| 5 | Sausage Party| $6,500,000 | $103,645,124 | 4 |\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* We are in the doldrums of deadzone between summer and Oscar season here folks so strap in for either the most boring or most odd time of the year. The first oddity is **Don\'t Breathe** which bucked the current trend of well opening horror film dropping like a stone on their second weekend as it came in #1 with $19.5 mil. Not only did it drop only 26% for the overall 4 day total but it also dropped only 40% for the three day total. That\'s pretty damn impressive when you compare it to other horror films like The Conjuring 2 which dropped over 60% on its second weekend. Clearly putting the film in prime location for a Labor Day weekend bump paid off, as the $10 mil budgeted film has now passed $50 mil domestic. \r\n\r\n* Just when I think I\'m done talking about **Suicide Squad** it pulls me back in. Don\'t worry DC heads, let\'s take the day off and just enjoy the definite successes of Suicide Squad. First up the film (much like another August release superhero film) actually went up 4.5% in the overall 4 day weekend and only dropped 20% for it\'s three day total which helped it retain it\'s #2 spot with $12.8 mil. This actually pushed the film into $300 mil domestic, the eighth film of the year to do so. This is also the fourth superhero film of the year to pass $300 mil domestic and gives DC/WB the honor of being the first studio ever to have two superhero films pass $300 mil in the same year. Internationally film is still doing decently well, adding about $12 mil from various markets. It\'s also about to open in Japan which has become the go-to country for a late run megaboost so it will be interesting to see how it pans out there. The film should easily pass $700 mil worldwide in the coming weeks. So despite my constant nagging about legs the film has done quite well recently. It will be interesting to see if this trend of putting less sure fire hits at the end of August as an alternative to the September box office blues continues. \r\n\r\n* While it was a good steady week for the older films, the new releases did not benefit at all from the Labor Day bump. First up is **The Light Between Oceans**, the new romantic melodrama from Derek Cianfrance that couldn\'t use the allure that lead stars Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander fell in love during filming to bring out the crowds. The film opened at #8 with $5.9 mil. Unfortunately Fassbender and Vikander (Fassander? Vikbender?) probably just aren\'t big enough stars on their own right yet despite incredible acclaim and a recent oscar win for Alicia. The film\'s best hope was to be released in Oscar season with buzz behind it but with the film finished for almost two years and the middling reviews it seems that the studio was likely unsure of the film\'s Oscar potential and dumped it into the wild west of September. And then there\'s **Morgan**, a film so few people knew about it didn\'t even make news that it it\'s three day pull of $1.9 mil makes it the seventh worst wide release opening of all time with an abysmal per theater average of only $908. In comparison Ghostbusters per theater average for the three day was $971 for it\'s 8th week. Morgan (which sees the directorial debut of Ridley Scott\'s son Luke Scott) ended up at an abysmal #17 for the four day weekend with $2.4 mil. The film also earned a terrible C+ rating on Cinemascore, so it may struggle to pass even its meager $8 mil budget. However one new film played the small stakes game this week and won big. **No Manches Frida** is the latest Spanish language film from Pantelion Films, a Lionsgate subsidiary that has found great success in the growing Spanish language market. No Manches Frida opened in only 362 screens at #12 with $4.6 mil for the opening weekend. That gives the film a huge per theater average of $12,845 and it made almost double what Morgan made on 1,700 less screens. Pantellion has had a great run lately with hits like Un gallo con muchos huevos and Spare Parts and have clearly become the leader in eeking out good returns from targeted market releases. \r\n\r\n* Small side note, this was a very odd week as no films in the top five were new releases. I checked and the last time this happened was [January 1-3, 2016](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=2016&wknd=01&p=.htm), but that weekend didn\'t have any new wide releases period! A better example would be [October 30 - November 1, 2015](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=2015&wknd=44&p=.htm), which saw the wide release of Burnt just barely miss the top 5. \r\n\r\n* Finally this week **[a great article was published by Bloomberg that states 17 films have lost the studios an estimated total of $915 mil this year.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-01/hollywood-s-summertime-bombs-got-a-lot-more-disastrous-this-year)** The whole article is worth a read but here are some highlights. Not only have 17 films lost an estimated $915 mil this year but last year the estimated total loss for failing films was $546 mil. Right now Paramount has it the worst with no hits and three of the top 10 worst failures of the year (TMNT II, Star Trek Beyond, and of course Ben-Hur). Disney also has three of the worst earners of the year (Alice Through the Looking Glass, The BFG, and Pete\'s Dragon) but with the top three domestic and top four international films of the year so far they certainly aren\'t hurting. Now these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt as the come from the website  The Numbers, a site that prides itself on having...well all the numbers but have been criticized for cutting corners and making assumptions, but I tend to think they are pretty close to the truth. What I find so interesting about this year is that overall the cinema isn\'t down considerably from previous years, it\'s more the insane gaps that have occurred. Just look [at the top grossing domestic films of the year](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2016&p=.htm) and you\'ll notice something very interesting. The #8 highest grossing film of the year so far is Suicide Squad at $300.2 mil. The #9 spot is Jason Bourne at $156.1 mil. That\'s a $144 mil drop from the #8 and #9 spot. So on the one hand you have more $300 mil+ films than ever before and yet not a single film in the $200 - $299 mil range. That kind of lack of diversity is troubling, especially since 4 of the top 8 are kids films and the other 4 are superhero films. Again don\'t think 2016 is the beginning for the end and next year will be New Hollywood 2.0. But it is telling that the gap between success and failure is widening each year. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

So I\'d like to hear what your hopes, fears, expectations and ideas are. A few points I\'d like to make:\r\n\r\n* I hope the film will use the fictional locations from the games. They have many countries and cities in the games based off IRL locations; Central City = San Francisco, Station Square = Manhattan, the United Federation = America, Spagonia = Western Europe, etc.. This wouldn\'t reduce suspension of disbelief anymore than freaky talking hedgehogs would - some of the most critically acclaimed movies in recent history (like The Dark Knight and TLotR) have fictional settings. Both examples are also adaptations, come to think of it. The PG-13 rating would also let them deconstruct the unified global millitary that the GUN seems to be.\r\n\r\n* The score could be really great in this film. The collective  Sonic soundtrack is one of the greatest in gaming, and using it in a movie (especially the electronic rock masterpieces of the early 3D era like Live and Learn and What I\'m Made Of) could make for a score that stands out from all the generic orchestra in modern superhero-type films.\r\n\r\n* I\'m crossing my fingers that it doesn\'t fall in the superhero movie trap of rushing character introductions to set up a fan-favorite for the inevitable sequel.\r\n\r\n* Remember the Quicksilver slow-mo scenes from the recent X-Men films? If a rival super-speedster like Shadow or Metal Sonic is in this movie, imagine a fight scene in that format!','Sonic the Hedgehog',18,37,'2016-09-16 18:27:32'),('53ahqg','Little known Peter Jackson horror comedy, The Frighteners - R.

Traditional biopics in general tend to be audience favorites (very few get a rating less than an A on Cinemascore) and it seems the same holds true here as Sully has now made $70.5 mil domestic. Hanks films in general have fantastic legs so don\'t expect this film to drop out any time soon. The best comparison will be Captain Phillips, which opened $10 mil less than Sully but ended up making over $100 mil domestic when all is said and done. However that film came out in October and had more Oscar buzz behind it than Sully seems to, so it will be interesting to see how Sully fares against bigger, splashier, buzzier movies like Birth of a Nation coming down the line. What is helping Sully though is increased ticket prices for the many IMAX showings it\'s currently in. Weirdly the marketing for the film has not mentioned the fact that the film was shot almost completely with IMAX cameras, which may have left behind a fair amount of market share of those who think it\'s not worth an extra $5 to see Tom Hanks\' mustache projected ten feet wide. The film should maintain enough legs to push it close to if not passed $100 mil, a pretty remarkable feet for a seemingly too highly budgeted biopic in September. \r\n\r\n* Seems the horror crowd isn\'t as in love with nostalgia as the rest of Hollywood as **Blair Witch**, the \'official\' follow-up to The Blair Witch Project, came in #2 with $9.6 mil. This is a pretty pathetic haul for the follow up, even with a very low budget of $5 mil. Even the most pessimistic predictions placed the film in the low teens, so to not even pass $10 mil for a follow up to the biggest ROI horror film of all time is pretty shocking. While the film\'s existence was kept under wraps until a few months ago, after the reveal the marketing for the film was everywhere and clearly Lionsgate thought the shocking reveal would create the kind of internet firestorm that led to the original\'s massive success (as well as maybe capture the 10 Cloverfield Lane magic) but clearly that didn\'t happen here. It doesn\'t help the film was savaged by critics and got an abysmal D+ on Cinemascore, the same score the flop The Disappointments Room got last week. It will be interesting to see how the legs for this film will compare to The Witch, a more critically loved but audience hated horror film that also came out in a weird month with little direct competition. The film will almost certainly pale in comparison to Don\'t Breathe, which should have dropped 60% or more this weekend due to direct horror competition but has maintained its steady course making just $4 mil less than Blair Witch on its 4th weekend. As stated with a budget of $5 mil and a shortened (if still intense) media blitz Lionsgate probably won\'t have to write-off any losses, but still this clearly puts a nail in the coffin to the idea that nostalgic reboots can work in horror. \r\n\r\n* Speaking of sequels to franchises that probably lost their audience years ago, **Bridget Jones\'s Baby** opened this weekend at #3 with $8.2 mil. The long, long in-development sequel opened to a domestic franchise low despite positive critical reviews. That being said Bridget Jones\'s Baby (okay I always though when you add a possessive to the end of a word ending in -s you do it like this: Bridget Jones\' Baby. Have I been wrong my whole life?) made only $400,000 less than previous film, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, but that was in 2004 when films had much more time to make back their money and Edge of Reason made $8.6 mil in only 500 theaters while Bridget Jones\'s Baby made about the same in 2,900 theaters. However all this domestic talk doesn\'t really matter as Jones has always been a more international franchise with both previous entries making over $200 mil abroad. Those films made the majority of their foreign profits in France, Germany and of course the UK. Already the film has made $29.9 mil in international markets, mainly in the UK where it had best opening ever for a rom-com coming in #1 with $11.3 mil. It will be interesting to watch the international market for this one as the domestic angle seems pretty much done for this franchise unless it has surprising legs next weekend. \r\n \r\n* Seems the magic of Sully couldn\'t extend to the other biopic this week about a very recent figure in history this, **Snowden**, which came in at #4 with $8 mil. This marks the worst wide release opening for Oliver Stone since 1997\'s U-Turn. While Snowden got the same mediocre reviews that most of Oliver Stone\'s latest films have received, it did garner an A on Cinemascore which may help it have some legs, not that it matters much with such a low opening. While Blair Witch and Bridget Jones\'s Baby also came in the same ballpark this weekend, Snowden is going to suffer more as it doesn\'t have the low budget of Witch and doesn\'t have the international appeal of Baby. With a reported budget of $40 mil Snowden doesn\'t really have a chance of making that back domestically and has very little plans to make it back internationally. In all honesty, Snowden just shows how remarkable Sully\'s success is. This is a classic Oscar never was, something made to profit off the buzz of Oscar but didn\'t have the goods to make it up. \r\n\r\n* This week also saw the release of two concert documentaries that came into varying results. First up was Christian film group Pure Flix\'s first concert doc, **Hillsong: Let Hope Rise** which opened at #13 with $1.3 mil in 816 theaters. This was actually a bit of a disappointment for Pure Flix as the film about Hillsong United, the most popular Christian rock group in the world, couldn\'t bring out the crowds it gets for its more political faith based films like God\'s Not Dead. The film only had a per theater average of $1,593 which means it just didn\'t get the devoted crowds it expected. In comparison, the new Ron Howard documentary **The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years** opened in only 85 theaters at #22 with $615,632. That\'s a per theater average of $7,243, a pretty surprising figure since the film produced and distributed by Hulu premiered today on the streaming service. It will be interesting to see if Hulu decides to run with the film in more theaters, especially if the theatrical showings bring out the older crowds who may not own streaming platforms. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Here\'s a comment on the original that I found on another site showing how it was surprisingly dark:\r\n\r\nSo is it going to be a bunch of middle aged men playing a board game?\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that cast, it seems like they\'re going for a harder comedy angle. The original was surprisingly dark in a lot of ways. \r\n\r\nKid spends half of his childhood and a large chunk of his adult life surviving by himself in a hellish jungle. When he gets out, he finds out his parents are both dead, likely from the stress of losing their only son. And the nice town went to complete shit. Girl who witnesses it has severe psychological problems extending well into her middle age. They meet some kids whose parents recently died and who are responding to it in surprisingly genuine ways (one refuses to speak, the other becomes a compulsive liar).\r\n\r\nAnd then they all play a nightmarish board game that tries to murder them with almost every turn and causes a small epidemic in the already shitty town. When the special effects don\'t look hokey, they can be kind of terrifying. The concepts alone can be kind of terrifying if you consider them outside of the lens of film. Huge mosquitoes with huge proboscis needles capable of breaking glass whose bites seem to cause some kind of paralysis, if not something worse. Plants that fire out poisonous barbs. Other plants that drag you into their asshole-looking mouths, surrounded by teeth like thorns, to be devoured. And vines strong and active enough to fold a car in half in 20 seconds. Then there\'s the wildlife which is much more vicious and aggressive, and sometimes just bigger than the real world equivalents. And then there\'s the bloodthirsty manhunter who looks like his target\'s father and is nearly superhuman (dude snaps a sword in half with his hand like it\'s made of plastic and survives getting crushed by a huge shelf stacked with full paint cans). Not to mention the general reality warping shit the game can do like turning the ground beneath your feet into some horrible, seemingly inescapable quicksand-like substance. Or when it turns the kid into some monkey thing for cheating. Yeah, maybe you can escape a lion, but if the game wants it can straight up change the substance of your being.\r\n\r\nAnd this was, for all intents and purposes, a family film. \r\n\r\nI hope they don\'t take the darkness out of Jumanji\'s dark adventure comedy.\r\n','The Good Liar',7,7,'2016-09-20 17:57:16'),('53vz9n','I would like to see a film adaptation of the 1991 science-fiction novel Fallen Angels.\"\" Here\'s why.\"\"','This story, for those of you who have not read it, is set in a future in which a far-left environmentalist party, allied with far right religious fundamentalists, takes control of the US government and institutes a series of laws severely restricting technology and pollution.  With no particulates in the atmosphere, cloud cover is disrupted, tilting the Earth into a mini-ice age.  Astronauts on orbit are chosen as scapegoats by the government, and a pair of them are shot down by an army missile.  Luckily, the astronauts are rescued from their crash landing by a group of science fiction fans, the last of their kind.  They travel the nearly-apocalyptic United States, searching for a Titan II rocket from the NASA Gemini program that could loft the astronauts back into orbit.\r\n\r\nWhile *Fallen Angels* is a book close to my heart, me being the sci-fi nerd that I am, I believe that there is an incredible opportunity for a story to be told to everyone, and for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n**Timing:** With the wonderful entertainment that is US politics fresh in everyone\'s mind, the political elements of the novel are ripe for satire.  In addition, themes of extremism, rebellion, and the environment are present, which are certainly hot topics for today.\r\n\r\n**Content:**  The novel is a consummate adventure: there is action, intrigue, daring rescues, comedic elements, near-future science fiction, romance, and of course, the concept of fandom.  The sci-fi fandom is nearly a character in and of itself in this film, and surely paying homage to the tropes and traditions of such a deeply ingrained part of our culture makes for a good film.\r\n\r\n**Originality:**  While yes, elements of the plot exist in many extant films, the work of Larry Niven has remained largely untapped for film potential, likely due to the amounts of hard physics he injects into his writing.  However, this story was not only written by him, and as such, is likely suitable for a larger audience.  Mind you, many of these audience members have been fed-up with poor reboots and sequels.  If handled well, this film would draw a strange new universe for people to be engaged with, near enough to our own to be familiar but different enough to allow for escapism.\r\n\r\nOf course, I would love to see *Ringworld* be adapted into a film, but any attempts save those of a large scale probably wouldn\'t do the book justice.  *Fallen Angels* is the perfect candidate for a blockbuster of a story, and I\'d like to see if anyone else thinks the same as I.

I think that something with more esoteric value that only real movie fans would appreciate. I would have to choose from the rug from the Big Lebowski or Steve McQueen\'s jacket from The Great Escape or the crown worn by Peter O\'Toole in Beckett. The rug is such a focal point of the movie. The jacket was the thing that gave Steve his swagger in the Great Escape. The crown would just be Peter O\'Toole cool. I wonder where some of these items are. There are some props that evoke magic.

I hope you\'re well.\r\n\r\nColor me strange. I don\'t like spoilers, and one of my favorite things about movies are twists and the journeys of discovery as movies unfold. Most people seem to avoid just not knowing movie endings. For most of my adult life, I\'ve been taking it further whenever I can, and I am curious if others do the same.\r\n\r\nThere are two main ways I go about doing this:\r\n\r\n1) I look for films that are highly-rated on both IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. If I am uncertain, I might look at the movie poster. If it seems intriguing enough, I\'ll add it to my watch list to view at a later time.\r\n\r\n2) I try to find out about movies that have not yet been released. Most of the time, they are in pre-production, and the films may not be released for 2 to 5 years. Because there is a lot of time between me reading about the movie and the movie\'s release - and my memory isn\'t perfect - I\'m usually okay reading the loglines and premises of these movies. I then add them to my IMDB Watchlist for viewing when they are released.\r\n\r\nFor these movies, I often have no idea what genre they are in when I start watching it, so my best guess is simply from the movie title and, sometimes, from the starring cast. I have watched horror movies thinking they\'re romantic comedies, and have watched love stories thinking they\'re musicals. I just finished watching a mystery drama in which I thought was sci-fi and was pretty sure aliens or something supernatural would show up; I was wrong.\r\n\r\nI am the only person doing this as far as I know.

Now if you compare Miss Peregrine to previous Burton films based on bigger adaptations like Alice in Wonderland then Peregrine fails but its opening fits pretty much alongside his less known adaptations like Dark Shadows ($29.6 mil) and Sleepy Hollow ($30 mil). Internationally the film is also doing decently well, opening $36.5 mil internationally with good showings in South Korea and Mexico. The YA adaptation did receive a decent B+ on Cinemascore as well, so the film should be looking at a $75 - $85 mil run by the end. Ultimately while probably not a massive success the film will likely justify it\'s $110 mil budget and likely will make more back the previous Burton effort Dark Shadows which cost $40 mil more and didn\'t have the international appeal that so far Miss Peregrine seems to have. \r\n\r\n* While certainly the surprise critical hit of the fall, Peter Berg and Mark Whalberg couldn\'t match the box office success of their previous film Lone Survivor as **Deepwater Horizon** opened at #2 to $20.6 mil. The film, based on the accident that started 2010 BP Oil Spill, received very good reviews and an A- on Cinemascore so it could hold well but perhaps the grim subject matter couldn\'t hook audiences at first as this was the worst opening for Berg since 2007\'s The Kingdom and came in $17 mil under Lone Survivors opening take. The film has faced criticism from the beginning for trying to make a $110 mil action movie out of a major environmental disasters which could be why the film couldn\'t quite compete with the more family friendly Peregrine, which had the same budget. Horizon should hold well (especially as an odd mix of prestige and action genre) but unless it continues to ride it\'s surprise critical acclaim to Oscar buzz it may not make enough to really justify itself. Internationally the film is doing fine, opening best overseas in UK for a total international opening of $12.4 mil. Still it\'s doubtful the film will find an international appeal and will have a long road ahead for domestic satisfaction. \r\n\r\n* The long stink that the failure of Relativity has left on the film landscape this year continues as their long delayed comedy-action film **Masterminds** finally opened with almost no marketing and made it to only #6 with $6.6 mil. The film was originally slated for a 2015 release but was canned when Relativity declared Chapter 11 last year. Now that Relativity is out of bankruptcy we are seeing their delayed releases finally trickle in this year but to horrible results. First up was Jane Got a Gun, a $25 mil Western (that the first director notoriously walked out on the first day of shooting) which ended up only making $1.5 mil. Then there\'s The Disappointments Room, one of the worst reviewed films of the year that couldn\'t even make back it\'s meager $15 mil budget, closing at $2.3 mil (the film did so bad I didn\'t even know it closed till I did research for this paragraph). And then there\'s Masterminds, which featured a pretty stacked cast (including oddly three of the four new Ghostbusters leads) and was supposed to be a new mainstream hit for general cult director Jared Hess. However with such a low opening and a B- Cinemascore, the film will struggle to make back even it\'s meager budget of $20 mil and marks another failure for Relativity which has not returned post bankruptcy with even worse relevance then when they disappeared. \r\n\r\n* It seems good reviews leading to a large release doesn\'t always work as **Queen of Katwe** couldn\'t translate the fabulous reviews it has received into anything of substance as its wide release only managed to score up a #7 spot with $2.2 mil for it\'s wide release. The film received a pretty low $2,100 per theater average, putting it on par with Sully inits fourth week of release. It\'s hard to say why the Disney inspirational sports drama failed to deliver on its wide expansion. Trailers seemed to be ever present in front of the many Disney hits this year, but perhaps the right audience wasn\'t reached or quite frankly chess is just not engaging enough of a sport to drive an audience in 2016. Katwe won\'t come close to its $15 mil budget and will have to rely on word of mouth to maybe make up the backend in rentals.\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

There was a lot to like, but what made it great wasn\'t Prim, or Katniss, but the *peacekeepers,* the faceless mooks we\'ve seen all through the movie.  Preblast, you see these faceless, frightening soldiers, polished and efficient.  They\'re fighting off rebel forces, dragging away prisoners into unmarked trucks.  Each soldier, before this scene, was an extreme presence in the huge crowd that Katniss and Gale were trying to navigate, and you feel tense whenever one of them looks in the protagonist\'s direction, let alone gets close.  \r\n\r\nBut in the aftermath of the first blast they\'re in total confusion.  No one know\'s what\'s going on, and for the first time most of the peacekeepers have removed their helmets, and they\'re stumbling around in the background, you see their actual faces now, and they\'re looking for survivors, trying to help the injured alongside rebel medics and rebel fighters.  \r\n\r\nIt was a small part of a big scene that had lots of other moving parts (like the frightened civilians reaching up for the bombs disguised as relief packages) but I thought what was done with the peacekeepers was one of the best parts of an all around solid movie.','The Aftermath',0,4,'2016-10-12 14:27:41'),('579750','The trailer for Two-Bit Waltz (2014).

[Serious]','I know that reboot is a term that the media often use to mean that a franchise like Spider-Man is making a comeback or starting from scratch, but is my understanding correct of the terms:\r\n\r\n----\r\n- **Reboot**: To start again from scratch, all previous continuity/canon is null and void. The Nolanverse Batman films, Marvel Cinematic Universe could probably count.\r\n\r\n- **Hard reboot**: None of the previous continuity is canon any longer - entirely new canon, back story, villains etc. but basics of the story/worldbuilding are retained [city, personalities etc.]\r\n\r\n- **Soft reboot**: Some of the previous canon/characters/continuity carry over to the new movie, but not all. Partially new, partially related to previous continuity.\r\n\r\n- **Remake**: Re-making the original film, with minimal or no changes in terms of plot or characters.\r\n\r\n- **Re-imagining**: Similar premise as the original but different in some ways [for example the made-for-TV Christmas Carol films, The March Sisters at Christmas which starred Julie Anne Berman and Kaitlyn Doubleday [the sister of Portia Doubleday from Mr. Robot] [I believe the film was a retelling, remake of Louisa May Alcott\'s Little Women, as i understand it].\r\n\r\n- **Alternate continuity**: It\'s canon, but the continuity is different from the original. Not quite the same as a spin-off. [Transformers is about the best example I can think of, apart from Marvel/DC Comics - the TV shows Arrow/The Flash/Supergirl are not part of the movie continuity, unlike the Marvel TV shows, as I understand it.].\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct, and how long would you say a reboot typically lasts? \r\n\r\nI am aware that many film series can be continuity-heavy, for example X-Men, Transformers, Captain America etc.\r\n\r\nI am just checking to ensure that my understanding of film jargon is correct.','Little Women',1,7,'2016-11-07 11:46:00'),('5bwjbp','Even Hangmen die (Fritz Lang)','I just watched Hangmen also die!, (Fritz Lang, 1943).

That represents a pretty impressive 49% drop, the third best second weekend drop for an MCU film (behind Iron Man and Thor). This pushes the domestic haul of Strange to $153 mil and pushes Disney past $2.3 bil domestic, the best ever for the studio. That is pretty impressive considering the studio already has Moana and Rogue One in the wings and last year they delivered The Force Awakens, the best domestic grossing film of all time by $175 mil. Doctor Strange has also already earned $339 mil in foreign markets including $44 mil in China and $30 mil in South Korea. The film will surpass $500 mil by tomorrow, making it the 12th highest grossing film of 2016 in just two weeks. However Doctor Strange\'s run may be quickly winding down with the upcoming juggernaut Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them about to hit US and foreign shores. \r\n\r\n* The weird thing about critics is that sometimes they matter a lot and sometimes they don\'t matter at all. In the case of **Arrival** I think it was the incredible critical reviews that pushed the film to outperform expectations (around $15 mil - $18 mil were the predictions) to come in with a quite good $24 mil opening at #3. While this doesn\'t match the heights of Interstellar or The Martian, this does represent the best opening weekend for director Denis Villeneuve. The big test now for the film will be word of mouth which is where one might have some concern as the film scored a pretty middling B on Cinemascore. This score could mark a frustration with audiences in the lack of action in Arrival or a perceived misrepresentation in the marketing. However films like 10 Cloverfield Lane (B-) have managed to still have good legs despite disappointing Cinemascores, so really it is up to friends and family on this one. Since the film has a fairly positive spin on global politics it might emerge as a good political climate antidote or a potential Oscar candidate with rising potential nominations for Amy Adams and Best Picture. Despite even the worst legs, the opening gives the $47 mil sci-fi film some good cushion that at the very least will justify its creation by the end of everything. \r\n\r\n* It seems it\'s not just Christmas decorations and shopping that can\'t wait till after Thanksgiving as **Almost Christmas** premiered a month and a half before the holiday to a solid #4 with $15.5 mil. The film, which features an all black cast, performed to an 81% non-white crowd and a crowd that was 60% over the age of 25. While the loss of a more global audience means the film may have left a couple million on opening, it does mean the film has a built in market which could give it good legs in the future, especially with the A- on Cinemascore. With a budget of $17 mil the film has almost already surpassed its budget even with its soft opening so barring some intense drops the film should at least squeak into profitability by the end.\r\n\r\n* In the latest in a run of films like Max Steel and The Disappointments Room, **Shut In** seems to be another film that wasn\'t so much released as dumped into theaters. The film wasn\'t screened for critics but the few that paid up for the film gave it an abysmal 0% on RT and 24/100 on Metacritic. With so little advertising and awful reviews it\'s no wonder the film premiered at #7 with an awful $3.7 mil. Even with a budget of $10 mil this film will struggle to make a profit.\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Jodie Foster - Money Monster was pretty good but it was the most expensive movie she has ever made ($30 Million) which is about $170 Million less than Captain Marvels presumed budget. \r\n\r\n2. Kathryn Bigelow - Prob the best female director and one of the best directors period but she probably won\'t do this movie because she likes to do real life events. Plus they already have writers and she works exclusively with Mark Boal. \r\n\r\n3. Ava DuVernay - Selma was really good and it was nominated for best picture. She is already working with Disney for a Wrinkle in Time. \r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nThose are all the good female directors I can think of.

Every character says the appropriate or realistic (what you would think someone would say) thing in every given situation/scene. This does not make the film predictable at all. They use editing as a stylistic device to reveal more and more of the plot/narrative and character development to the audience, which is why this film deserves at least to be nominated for Best Editing because it is very well done. This is not a movie you try to figure out right away, it’s a film you watch and experience. It is very slow paced and subtle. Subtle shows itself sometime in character development and script, which also adds to character development. Which intense development there is in the movie if you really pay attention and listen to the words the main characters use when they talk. The director has written the most realistic dialogue I’ve heard and also at times enlightening and emotion -evoking which also happens through acting. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s a very hard thing to accomplish as well as it is accomplished in this film from a writing standpoint. This film will win the Oscar for best Original Screenplay. Speaking of which, the screenplay does a flawless job switching between  tragic heartbreaking sadness and hearty, very witty and organic humor. There was way more comedy in this movie than I had expected, and it’s original and natural and again realistic, The way Casey Affleck’s character interacts with the kid is one example of juxtapositions between good and bad times both always with the proper and accurately written dialogue that’s also original. But don’t get me wrong, this is also one of the saddest films I’ve experienced, and it’s a real kind of sadness because of the accurate and plentiful character development and relationships that are created through script and acting. Their relationship is the primary focus of the movie, but there are a great many other significant events that occur, that range from subtle to intense. It probably could have used a little more intensity, but it is real, and thus that more emotionally impactful on the audience. I believe they have the most scenes together, all well written. Incredibly realistic dialogue in the form of dinner table arguments and such. Those scenes are emotionally intense. Speaking of emotional intensity that’s remarkable and accurately conveyed, Casey Affleck delivers one of  my most favorite acting performances of this decade so far maybe beyond. He will win the Oscar for Best Actor. The way he portrays true emotional suffering and pain come off both unique to him as an actor and also very organically or natural. And I didn’t like him too much before this film. Some could argue his role in Gone Baby Gone is equivalent to Leo DiCaprio’s role in the Departed in which they elevate their acting game to a mature level where they play strong male characters, but this film might be the true transformation of Casey Affleck as a truly gifted actor. Casey Affleck definitely bulked up for this movie. One complaint I do have about the film is there isn’t enough Michelle Williams in it. She’s an amazing actress and is rumored to be nominated for Supporting Actress based basically on one scene, grant it I think it’s one of the most powerful scenes in the movie, of which there’s a respectable amount of. There’s a lot of subtle and slow character development. Another complaint is I would cut like at least 15 to 20 mins of the film, not every scene is necessary, especially one’s without dialogue of which there are enough of to add to the slow pace of the movie and plot itself. Many people will find this movie boring. They’d prefer movies that are escapist, or have fantastical elements as a way to travel to amazing places and see amazing things as you forget about real life for 2 hours. That is not me though. I like good hard doses and depictions of real life and how hard and painful it is for many. It makes me immensely grateful and I feel very fortunate. This film is for people value and appreciate the small, subtle and accurate techniques of film and story, versus and more action driven written plot. This film  is about amazing and realistic character development and more importantly true emotions like happiness and sadness. And for screenwriter’s it’s much harder to accomplish correctly. This film should also be nominated for Best Picture, and I imagine La La Land will be the stiff competition. This film should also be nominated for its soundtrack, each scene a different type of music is played and is applies appropriately to the scene itself and creating the mood. Soundtracks that are great either convey mood or tension very accurately or uniquely, ways never done before. As far as comparison to La La Land, Damien Chazelle who is helming La La is very good at selecting music for his films, see Whiplash as a reference, as well as editing, see Whiplash as well for reference of this. I imagine the film  will be a huge improvement from Whiplash. As for Manchester, the deep heartbreaking emotion that the film so powerfully yet so subtley conveys, full of realistic originality and the small complexities in simplicity still has me emotionally affected at the moment of writing this, 3 hours after viewing. Lucas Hedges also deserves a nomination for best Supporting Actor, which is remarkable for being so young, and incredible breakthrough performance here.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\n\r\n\r\nExtreme Pros: Casey Affleck’s performance and the Screenplay\r\n\r\n\r\nPros: Accurate and effective depiction of a range of human emotion thanks to script and acting (see Extreme Pros), Editing, Character Development, Soundtrack, Originality, Subtlety, Accuracy, Depth, also subtle but effective, Comedy, in many scenes of dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nCons: Length combined with pacing may be a problem who don’t appreciate true subtle ways you can be so remarkably effective at conveying real emotion and other things. Most plot evens are not of high climax. The intense sadness of the movie could turn people off, as true and accurately conveyed as it is. Not enough use of Michelle Williams. Too many scenes of seashores with the town in the background and sail boats at the forefront and no dialogue. \r\n\r\n\r\nScore: 95-97/100\r\n','Breakthrough',3,4,'2016-11-27 20:43:24'),('5fbv7v','Never liked Firefly or Serenity, but this Serenity review finally explained to me why so many people are die hard fans and what it means to them','','Serenity',779,191,'2016-11-28 09:16:44'),('5fdhtj','What movie is this?','I remember seeing this Asian action movie years ago.

Winter season is awards season so it\'s even less predictable as budgets aren\'t nearly as correlating with box office take as they are in the summer and fall times. Be sure to pay attention to theater counts as a lot of great movies get small releases then widen as word of mouth gets passed around. \r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren\'t a member of the /r/movies Fantasy Movie League, now is a perfect time to join with the new season beginning **this Friday!** It\'s a simple concept. You own a fantasy theater and it\'s your job every week to fill up your eight screens with currently playing movies. Depending on how well the movies are projected to do they will cost different amounts so you must fill your screens while staying within the universal budget of 1,000 FML Bux. You can play the same movie multiple times or leave screens blank at the cost of a small penalty, and there are bonuses for choosing the movie that makes the most per dollar spent and getting the perfect lineup! It\'s a season long game so if a week or two don\'t go your way you\'re not out of the running at all! As you can see, the difference between 1st and 10th place this season was over 80 million! \r\n\r\nIf you want to join just follow this link:\r\n\r\nhttps://fantasymovieleague.com/group/3185?seasonId=7\r\n\r\nMake a free account, and click join league.

Star Wars Episode 8. I LOVED The Force Awakens. It brought Star Wars back. I Loved Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren and I can\'t wait to see them again. Plus we got the director of Looper helming the project and Luke Skywalker is back.\r\n\r\n2. War For The Planet Of The Apes. War is coming. Rise and Dawn were both incredible film. What summer blockbusters should be. Someone please give Andy Serkis an Oscar for playing Ceaser. \r\n\r\n3. Logan. Best trailer of the year. I think this could be the best superhero film of next year. I\'m sad that Jackman is done as Wolverine after this, but if he wants to leave, he\'s earned it.\r\n\r\n4. Spider-Man Homecoming. Spider-Man is my role model. I loved him in Civil War and I love the idea of a coming of age Spidey story. We also got Birdman playing Vulture. I do have some concerns about having to much Stark and MCU tie ins, but I can\'t wait for Homecoming.\r\n\r\n5. Justice League. We finally get a Justice League movie. Of course I\'m excited. Yes BVS was disappointing, but Snyder heard the response and he\'s trying to fix some of the mistakes. Plus Ben Affleck has creative control as well.\r\n\r\n6. Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2. I\'m hooked on a feeling after seeing the new trailer. Baby Groot looks adorable and badass. And we got Kurt Russel and Chris Pratt playing father and son.\r\n\r\n7. Dunkirk. When Christopher Nolan has a new movie coming out, you get excited. This could be his Saving Private Ryan. Great cast as well with Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy.\r\n\r\n8. Thor Ragnarok. I love the first Thor and liked the second one okay. I love the idea of this one being more cosmic. Plus you got Cate Blanchett as the bad guy and Hulk and Thor teaming up!\r\n\r\n9. Wonder Woman. Best Comic Con trailer. Gal Gadot really surprised me in BVS. I didn\'t expect a lot from her, but she was one the best things in the film. And I\'m excited to see her origin on film for the first time.\r\n\r\n10. Alien Covenent. That poster. Awesome. Ridley Scott has started to make a comeback with The Martian. I can\'t wait for a great sci fy horror film.\r\n\r\n11. Kingsman 2. Kingsman Secret Service was awesome. Matthew Vaughn is coming back for a sequel. I\'m also curious how Colin Firth will comeback.\r\n\r\n12. Kong Skull Island. KONG!!\r\n\r\n13. Cars 3. That trailer really surprised me. They seem to be going for a darker film. Plus it\'s Pixar.\r\n\r\n14. Despicable Me 3. The first 2 are great family films. I\'m sure 3 will be great to.\r\n\r\n15. Paddington 2. The first one was very charming and sweet. I want more of that cute bear.\r\n\r\n16. The Dark Tower. Sci fy and western mixed together. Lets hope it\'s better than Cowboys and Aliens.\r\n\r\n17. Baby Driver. Edger Wright\'s new film with Lilly James. I\'m in.\r\n\r\n18. Split. M Night started his comeback with The Visit. This seems to continue that.\r\n\r\n19. Coco. It\'s Pixar. You gotta be excited.\r\n\r\n20. Beauty And The Beast/Power Rangers/LEGO Batman. Disney has been doing great with live action remakes like Jungle Book and Cinderalla. I\'m liking this new take on the Rangers. Batman was one of the best parts of The LEGO Movie so give him his own film.\r\n\r\nThese next ones are films that got released in 2016, but I can\'t see them until next month so they aren\'t on the other list.\r\n\r\n1. La La Land. Whiplash is one of my favorite movies. Even though musicals aren\'t my favorite genre, the trailers have been great and I trust the director.\r\n\r\n2. Silence. A new Martin Scorsese film with Andrew Garfield. Do I have to say anymore?\r\n\r\n3. Live By Night. Ben Affleck directing a gangster film? I\'m in.\r\n\r\n4. The Founder. The Keaton Komeback continues with the origin of Mcdonald\'s.\r\n\r\n5. A Monster Calls. Very emotional trailers.','Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker',9,53,'2016-12-06 17:17:13'),('5h1fr9','Question: Forrest Gump author vs Sean Connery and net profits....','Every time I see an article about Sean Connery turning down the role of Gandalf, it always mentions how he missed out on a huge payday because they [offered him 15% of net profits from the movie](http://www.nme.com/news/film/sean-connery-turned-down-megabucks-role-in-lord-of-877373).\r\n\r\nEvery time I see Forrest Gump mentioned, someone talks about the [author missing out on his cut of the net profits](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/25/movies/gump-a-huge-hit-still-isn-t-raking-in-huge-profits-hmm.html).

Alien: Covenant - going be a good film, I think, between Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride and all these super fascinating elements to do with the Xenomorphs, the Covenant ship and just the premise of the movie. As someone who\'s enjoyed all Alien films, even Aliens which wasn\'t my thing mostly, I\'m looking forward to this and hope the trailer\'ll drop not too long from now - http://www.slashfilm.com/alien-covenant-plot/\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Kong: Skull Island - monsters, monsters and more monsters. Got a GREAT cast, with greats like Goodman, Jackson, Larson and Hiddleston. A gargantuan King Kong and some very exciting footage so far. I hope it\'ll be a good film and that it lays some interesting groundwork for Kong vs Godzilla. Trailer 2 follows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0-9FBs2Rs\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Justice League - much like the Avengers movie a few years ago, it finally brings together a superhero team that should\'ve hit the silver screen many years ago. Hopefully a grand epic, to be sure, between Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Batman (Ben Affleck), Flash (Ezra Miller), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). I\'m looking forward to seeing this brought to the big screen at last, all these heroes fighting together, many for the first time. Hopefully a DC film that will make up for stuff like MOS, BVS or SS, and be worth the wait: Comic Con Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gglkYMGRYlE\r\n\r\n\r\n4. War for the Planet of the Apes - the 9th film in the franchise, the 3rd film in this series. Might conclude things nicely for the Andy Serkis iteration, or only help to expand things further in the POTA series. Some wonderful effects, great action, good horror and suspense. Strong emotion and great messages and subtext to it all. Love these Apes films, have since my childhood to a degree, but last few years, between originals and new especially. Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEP1Mk6Un98\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Thor: Ragnarok - You\'ve got Hulk, you\'ve got Loki working with Thor again. You\'ve got Valkyrie popping in for the first time, plus a villain like Hela, played by a legend like Cate Blanchett. Plus, Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster, brother to Benicio Del Toro\'s Collector in Guardians. Gonna be action, gonna be team ups, gonna be humour, gonna be fun. I hope it has a nice amount of an epic feel, good travelling around the cosmos. Some good fun mish mash of personalities and a mad Odin running around. Be good fun - plus, Karl Urban as Skurge! http://www.cinemablend.com/new/5-Huge-Things-We-Just-Learned-About-Thor-Ragnarok-132307.html\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Beauty and the Beast - I\'m definitely looking forward to this one. Between such amazing visuals and cast, lovely stuff matching up with the original Disney film. Hopefully between Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, or Emma Watson as Belle and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts, they have the right people for such classic roles. I\'m definitely looking forward to this tale as old as time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvW_L8sTu5E\r\n\r\nThose are some of my most anticipated films of 2017, plus of course Guardians 2, Spidey Homecoming + Wonder Woman. I\'ll see about Pixar\'s Coco, not sure what Dreamworks has in store next year. Blade Runner 2049 will hopefully be awesome too.\r\n','Godzilla: King of the Monsters',265,441,'2016-12-11 15:45:21'),('5hsq82','Serenity - Bloopers/Gag Reel','','Serenity',2,0,'2016-12-11 17:04:59'),('5i109d','Has anyone here gotten a chance to see \'My Life as a Zucchini\' / \'Ma vie de Courgette\' ; After reading some reviews I\'m very interested in seeing it, but it\'s a French film so I\'m not entirely sure about a possible English release or translation in the future','[Here is the IMDB for the film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321405/)\r\n\r\nWhile I love movies in general, animation has and always will hold a place in my heart; I adore animation of all sorts and this movie has grasped my interest.

It doesn\'t matter anyhow because this is one of those movies you have to see for yourself to really grasp just how monumentally horrible it really is so if you haven\'t seen it yet I\'d stop here so the magic of this movie isn\'t ruined for you. If you don\'t care either way, then press on.\r\n\r\n \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now sometimes it\'s hard to rag on a movie when I know damn well, I probably couldn\'t have done any better than what has already been presented in the final cut. Although in this case, two preschoolers, a clinically brain dead accident victim and a hamster probably could have provided more than what we got. But I\'d like to say the difference between me and the folks producing trash like this is that I know better than to even try or, at the very least, I would hire a reputable hamster who can vouch for the preschoolers and the poor brain damaged fellow.  But what are we really talking about here? A very bad movie starring, Dominic Monaghan, who\'s claim to fame is playing a Hobbit and a drug addled rock and roll star on the equally dismal television show, LOST. That\'s O.K. though, because if I\'ve said it once, I\'ve said it a thousand times, the only thing better than a great movie, is a really bad one. And that is just what we have and I couldn\'t be happier. Let’s get started, shall we.\r\n   \r\n    \r\n \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movie starts off with great intentions that quickly landslides the moment anyone on camera opens their mouth. Now, it would seem that, Carles Torrens, the director of this mess has cast his entire movie with actors who haven’t the ability to act. But this is not true because I\'ve seen, Lost and the lord of the Rings trilogy, and although I despised the former with ever fiber, and disregard the latter as an elaborate puppet show, I somehow remember Monaghan being able to act slightly. That is not the case here, however. Every line is delivered with an irresolute confidence, much like high school drama student reading off a cue card and in a fair competition between the two, the high school drama student goes home with the Oscar every time. Perhaps Monaghan’s performance has been hindered in an attempt to hide his native accent with one that wouldn’t fit anywhere in the continental U.S.? Probably not the case either. And this menagerie of bad acting doesn’t stop with Monaghan. Now our female lead/pet, Ksenia Solo, who I believe has been in a number of television productions also phones this one in. The harder she tries to convince you of just how crazy she really is, the farther she lands from her mark. When I think of crazy, a few names pop into my head. Norman Bates, Hannibal Lecter, Tila Tequila, to name a few. When I think of transparency and disbelief, Monaghan and Solo are in the top ten. But these two don’t shine alone because the rest of the cast is just as bad. This makes me think that Mr. Torrens is either purposely directing this way or he just doesn’t give a crap. I’m splitting the aces on that last comment because bad acting seems to be a main staple in all of his movies. Check out Apartment 143 if you think I’m lying. \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the story has been penned by, Jeremy Slater, one of the authors of 2015’s complete and absolutely unnecessary, as well as, inferior remake of the Fantastic Four.  That should really be all I need to say about that. But what fun would that be? \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seth is your archetypal creepy, looser who’s working in a Los Angeles animal shelter. Pretty perfect so far, Right? He’s the kind of guy that couldn\'t score in whore-house with bag of hundred dollar bills and he knows this fact well and so does everyone around him. Seth, the terminally shy guy, who\'s been pissed on by everyone he\'s ever met, including the animal shelters house Veterinarian, who even chastises poor Seth for not stepping up to adopt a German Shepard that is about to be put down. This guy, who *really* can’t act, basically calls him a coward looser for not having the stones to uproot his life, find a new apartment that allows and could accommodate a huge German Shepard on poor, poor pitiful Seth’s meager hourly rate. I found this mighty ironic coming from someone who most likely owns his own home and makes a tidy sum. I also found it in such bad taste that he would do this while holding the lethal injection in one hand and pointing the finger at our hero with the other. Shame on you, Doc! How I wanted that poor dog to rip the Doctors face from his skull so he would not be able to speak another line of dialogue, for Seth’s sake, our sake and most importantly, the dogs. But thankfully that was his one and only show stopping scene. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our female lead, Holly, is a former high school hottie that Seth runs into on a bus one afternoon. She’s very attractive and obviously way out of Seth’s league, but that is not going to stop Seth from giving it the old college try. He approaches her, mumbles a few words of introduction and after this awkward exchange, it’s made clear that Holly has no idea that Seth existed back then, has no interest in the slightest now and as the movie limps forward, she barley remembers him every time he shows up to stalk her. Holly sprints off the bus and leaves a bewildered Seth behind who only then musters the courage to ask her out as the bus closes its doors and has moved on a full block.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of this disappointment, Seth goes home and begins searching for any and all information online about his new love interest. He does this with the help of the fictitious search engine, SLEUTH.  You know a movie is bad when not even Google will take a little free advertising. So now armed with a plethora of information on his girl a little reluctant advice from a Security guard at work, who by the way also hates Seth, he begins the unlikely transformation from shy hobbit with no backbone what-so-ever to determined evil genius. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning the location of the diner Holly waitresses at, Seth goes for round two where once again Holly has no idea who this guy is and the whole scene plays out very disturbing with Seth trying to overcompensate his shyness with rude confidence. He not only doesn’t get a date but ends up freaking Holy out when she tells him in the nicest way possible that she has a boyfriend. With this, he looks her dead in the eye’s and says, “no you don’t.” In an angry and fearful move, Holly slaps the check on the counter and leaves the scene. Any normal person would have just left and went back to their miserable lives. Not Seth beacuse he’s not ready to give up just yet. For a moment, I felt genuinely worried for old Holly who high tails it home in fear of being followed by a Hobbit with convoluted intentions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, she is greeted by her tatted up obnoxious roommate, Claire, who’s only concern for Holly is urging her to forgive her Ex-boyfriend, Eric, for his cheating ways and moving on with her life. Pretty caring friend, Or is she?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seth by this point is transforming from timid and harmless to obsessed and intimidating and is ever so closer to to the full-fledged stalker he is trying so hard to be. After being let down so harshly at the diner, he goes home and starts looking for more information with the help of, Sleuth, of course. Sometime later, he follows Holly to a bar where her ex boyfriend works and pleads with him to stop sending her flowers, sighting that it is a nice gesture but completely inappropriate. Eric looks a little confused by this, but I think that\'s just how he normally looks. Holly steps outside to have a cigarette and to write in her journal and who should step outside only moments later but Seth. She warns Seth of the evils of smoking obviously not recognizing him again and why should she, he’s only following her everywhere she goes. Well that is until he turns his head so she can now see his face and asks if she liked the flowers, claiming that she looked like the White and Red roses kind of girl. Holly is understandingly shocked and appalled at this because she is in fact a daffodil girl and despises roses, especially those sent by Seth. Holly slaps her way around Seth in a rage, and runs back into the bar where Eric lays him out with one punch. In the scuffle, Holly has dropped the journal we’ve seen her writing in many times and Seth scoops it up off the floor along with himself and absconds with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at his apartment, Seth begins vigorously reading Holly\'s memoirs and finds this new literary peephole to be very enlightening. So enlightening in fact that he suddenly has a new mission in life. Once again with the help of the great and powerful, Sleuth, he begins to scour the internet looking for welding equipment and components which he is suddenly able to afford on his $9.00 an hour salary. He begins begins building a cage of immense proportions that he plans to keep in an unused area of the Animal Shelters that he had earlier scouted. Next, he steals various drugs from the vet’s office, which I’m sure they never count and he even tries one out on himself first by putting the longest needle I’ve ever seen way too deep in his arm and falling flat on his face. What a kidder, huh?\r\n   \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I’ve spent half my life working construction of sorts and I gave welding a go once and let me tell you it’s not something just anyone can do on a lark. But it would seem that Seth is a natural when it comes to joining of metals. A master of metallurgy you might say because for his first time out he builds a pretty serious human sized cage with all the comforts of home including a rotating, lazy Susan type door for a bed pan to be inserted and removed easily with little mess. This man has gone from Gomer Pyle to Lex Luther in a matter of days and I’m sure the fellows over at, Sleuth, should take some credit for this. He also has skills in the kidnapping department as well for he breaks into Holly’s apartment with the ease of cat burglar and quickly subdues her. To put her mind at ease, because that’s that kind of guy Seth is, he tells her not to worry about the needle he is about ram into her because he tried it on himself first. It would seem that chivalry is alive and well in greater Los Angeles area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with her safely sleeping off a completely safe animal tranquilizer, Seth packages her up and somehow transports this huge box across town with aid of only a hand truck. Completely reasonable because everyone knows that Los Angeles is a relatively small community. Once he arrives, package in hand, he tries to sneak past the animal shelters around the clock, narcoleptic, security guard who is as inept as he is large. Seth just about makes it when our security expert hears a strange garbled noise that startles him from his slumber. This, of course would be our damsel in distress coming out of her own slumber. Being the crafty evil genius Seth has become, he lets out a cough that will no doubt throw this security blood hound way off his trail and save his hide. But it doesn’t and only after a few tense moments when all seems to be lost for our hero, the air-conditioner noisily kicks on and even though it sounds nothing like what aroused the security man’s suspicion, being a trained expert and exceptionally lazy man, he is quickly convinced that this must be what he had heard and after helping Seth pull his heavy box back on to the wheels of the hand truck, he saunters back to his desk to continue working on his own coma and a Twinkie or three. That was close one, wasn’t it kids?\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of a bit of movie magic, tiny Seth somehow manages to get a heavy gauged steel cage with a woman inside down several sets of stairs without making a noise or killing himself in the process.  Holly wakes up in this finely crafted cage that Seth spent his life savings to build. Is she appreciative? Of course, she isn’t. No one appreciates Seth, it’s his curse. So, a few slurred f-bombs from our pet and some terrible dialogue later, Seth tells Holly he is going to save her. Grab your bibles, folks, this could get religious.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, tired and frustrated, Holly takes out her anger by destroying a rat that was simply welcoming her to the neighborhood with the heel of her foot. The scene seemed quite excessive for such a lacy personality like Holly\'s, but let face it, everything beyond the title cards in this movie seems a little excessive. But Holly isn’t as alone as we are first led to believe. After Seth visits her occasionally to bring her Big Kahuna burgers and water, which she refuses because I guess the rat was plenty to tamp down her appetite, she begins to hallucinate that her friend Claire (remember Claire) is with her and they enjoy some delusional chit chat until Seth lets her know that he sometimes hears this banter before entering the room and is very impressed with Holy’s ability to give her friend a real voice by using her own. This is where they say the plot thickens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that Seth is a man of his word and he really is trying to help Holly. After reading her journal and discovering that Holly has not only discovered that her best friend was doing the horizontal mambo with Eric (remember Eric) she is infuriated and decides to kill Claire by way of high speed car accident in an alleyway. However, this does not do the job, so after pulling a shard of glass from her own torso, lest we forget that all cars are equipped with safety glass so a shard is nothing short of miraculous, she takes the miracle shard and rams it into Claire’s left eye to seal the deal. But the blood lust doesn’t end here. In his pursuit of creepiness, Seth follows Holly all over the place and discovers that she is as well of an accomplished serial killer as he is a welder. We see several instances of her offing Los Angelinos for no apparent reason, my favorite being her setting a man on fire, all as Seth watches from the distance doing nothing at all. So now we know what he means when he says he wants to save her and if he can’t he might have to kill her. Holly and her imaginary construct of a friend, scoff at this because they know what it takes to kill, especially by lighter, and Seth is not a killer. They discuss this in some depth in a conversation that should have a purpose but comes off sounding like Bizaro worlds version of Quentin Tarantino dialogue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, things are starting to fall apart for poor Seth. He is neglecting his duties at work and receives a reprimand from another bad actor. The fat security guard is feeling overworked because Seth is now keeping such odd hours at the shelter and having to remind him to sign the log every time he shows up is starting to get cumbersome. One night Seth show’s what a bad-ass he really is by throwing a couple of candy bars at a starving Holly but she somehow sweet talks him into an extra bag of chips from the vending machine upstairs. After all, he loves her, and love does make us do the strangest things. So, while out procuring her meal, our security guard fools us all and actually gets up from his desk and witnesses Seth emerging from an “Off Limits” area of the Shelter. He investigates and finds Holly tucked away in her little cage. Shocked by what he finds, instead of immediately calling the police, he tries to break open the combination bicycle lock that stands between Holly and her freedom as she slings him some b.s. that is supposed to accentuate her manipulative manor. Now our security guard is as big as a house and if he had just imagined the lock as something like a Twizzler he probably could have freed her with one bite but instead is overtaken when Seth bashes him over the head with a flashlight and stabs him a few times with a pen knife that barley breaks the skin and only infuriates the security guard who throws Seth across the room. As he lunges toward Seth, Holly, in an unprecedented act, trips the fat man making him fall flat on his face and then coax’s Seth into bashing his skull in with a nearby cinderblock. Seth is in some hot water now and Holly makes sure he knows that without her help he is going to be in own cage very soon. But luckily for Seth, Holly knows just what to do and so Seth removes the man’s teeth as per Holly’s instructions, and with nothing more than a hacksaw, proceeds to cut the man up and then feed his remains to the dogs upstairs, all three hundred pounds of the man as well as his skeletal system, although we only see a couple of bowls with some sort of meat in them, it is strongly suggested that the rest of the fat man is being disposed of off camera. Perhaps by some hungry wild boar kept on the premises. Could a few mangy mutts effectively eradicate every last scrap of the poor late security guard? For Seth’s sake I hope so, but hey that’s just one of the many reasons why this movie made $70 dollars in box office receipts on it’s opening and closing night, (somewhere in the world) completely recouping it’s budget and still making a profit of $10.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, both having secretes, a sort of love/hate thing begins to bloom between the two. But things begin to boil for our Hobbit friend when a made for T.V. version of a homicide detective shows up with some questions for Seth and after effectively lying and getting caught at every turn he is somehow allowed to leave, go home and even bring Holly more Big Kahuna burgers and believe it or not, the detective bothers him no more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believing that they now share some bond and Seth has committed the ultimate act of sacrifice for the love of Holly, she turns the tides on him by somehow talking him into cutting off two of his own fingers in a sort of dare. I can’t tell you the why of this because my brain began to shut down at this point as it will do on those occasions when it cannot process something so unbelievably stupefying. I can only speculate, he does this all for love. But again, she turns the tides and snatches the knife from him and takes herself hostage by holding the knife to her own neck and demands that he let her out. Seth had now come full circle going from creepy pushover, to expert welder, to Diabolical genius, all the way to a mind-numbing moron and lets her out where she repays his hospitality and affection by slashing his throat. Oh, the humanity. Poor Seth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now find Holy back at her apartment as if nothing has happened with, Eric, the muse who started Holly down her murderous path. We think he is about to meet a horrifying end as Holly approaches the unsuspecting dumb ass from behind with something in her had. What is it? Is it a knife? Perhaps a gun? No, it’s a phone or television remote or something that won’t kill him and was supposed to be shocking and not what we expected but after an entire movie of things we shouldn’t have suspected, this has no affect at all and is about as cheap and cliché in a horror movie as jump scare from a lurking cat. But our story does not end here. What on earth has happened to Seth? Is he dead? You would think a slash to the throat and all that blood gushing from the wound would certainly indicate his demise, but you would be wrong. In the final scene of the movie, we follow Holly to some storage facility, where we find Seth, locked in his own cage, looking like one of the undead who hasn’t had his proper meal of blood for quite some time. It would seem that he has survived and is now Holly’s source of strength in this world and oddly enough Seth seems OK with all of this because love is a strong bond and it seems to be all he really needs as we watch faun upon holly like a loved starved zombie. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet, has taking me on a roller coaster of emotions that swell from WTF to My god they can’t be serious. Terrible acting, bad direction, and a script that barley had potential, all makes for my most beloved thing in this world: A very Bad movie. And if a bad movie is something you relish as well then by all means see this movie because it will not let you down, otherwise this is one to avoid at all costs and should not be viewed by pregnant woman or children with high I.Q.’s. It is entertaining but not for the reasons, Carle Torrens, believed it would be. And if there is any moral to taken away from this movie it would have to be that nothing ever turns out well for Creepy men, psychotic woman and German Shepard’s on death row. I believe Seth sums it all up nicely somewhere in the weak third act, “This is totally #uck@#!”\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well said, my boy. Well said.\r\n','A Dog\'s Way Home',1,2,'2016-12-15 17:08:02'),('5imegz','Hopefully one of you movie buffs can answer my question about the movie Honey I Shrunk The Kids\"\"\"\"','So I was watching this movie with my 5 year old (who loved it btw) and I went to see how much it would cost to purchase it on bluray.

I decided I would just watch the first and last movie, then try and see if I could guess what happens in between. So after finishing Furious 7, I\'ve come up with this.\r\n\r\nBrian clearly drops out of the force following the first movie and joins Dom for some heist-hijinks over the next couple of films, trying to make cash and satisfying their adrenaline addiction all the while becoming serious BFF’s. The sense of family the gang gets from working together helps override the guilt of breaking the law. In one of the films, they probably need to do a heist so that they can get cash for a noble cause, like saving one of their buddies in the hospital, such as not-quite-dead Jesse or not-quite-dead Vince. They are always successful but for various reasons never end up getting rich, because Dom is still living in that same dumpy house during Furious 7. One of the heists mostly takes place in the Dominican Republic where they make friends with whoever is hiding Mia during 7, as well. Eventually they are approached by the feds in one of the middle films for some sort of job that the government isn’t allowed to officially participate in. Also, the Dom and Brian wonder-team has garnered mad respect at this point and the feds think they are the only guys capable of getting it done. They probably are. \r\n\r\nIn the feds-heist film, Hobbs and Elena are introduced and tasked with helping Dom/Brian do their job, slash keeping an eye on them for the feds. Also at some point Dom and Hobbs get into fight, probably when Dom tries to screw over the feds during the heist job (breaks in police station, per Furious 7 quote?) and Hobbs tries to keep him in line. Hobbs kicks his ass because Dwayne Johnson is larger than Vin Diesel. Dom gets the best of him by the end of the film, though, probably in some sort of car chase.\r\n\r\nOnly because I’m aware that the third film is titled “Tokyo Drift”, the crew goes to Tokyo for some foreign heist and we are introduced to whoever this Sean guy is and Han. Han seems like he is more important and probably appeared in later movies since Jason Statham went after him during Furious 7 and he got his own funeral scene. He probably became pretty good BFF’s with Dom, but nowhere near the bromance he has with Brian. In Tokyo they deal with a healthy Johnny Tran and some of his pissed off relatives. Sean probably only ever returns in minor cameos since he has about 60 seconds of screen time in Furious 7. Same goes for Hector.\r\n\r\nVince and Harry get taken out in the second movie. Vince never fully recovers from the end of the first film, or he just wants out after almost dying. Harry is killed for minor drama and to make us hate some new antagonist. Their roles in the gang are replaced by Roman and Tej (who also replaces Jesse as the smart guy). \r\n\r\nI was legitimately surprised to see Letty and Dom still together in Furious 7 but there is 100% no way that relationship has existed smoothly for 6 films. They are married either in the second or third film and Dom gives her the cross-necklace as an impromptu wedding ring. Probably in the fourth film, Letty is involved in a highly dramatic car crash and is assumed to be dead. Audience agrees. Han later inspects crash and finds the cross-necklace but no Letty, doesn\'t look very hard because the car is already engulfed in flames, or something, and he assumes shes burned to a crisp. They don\'t have a chance to gather the burned body because the car explodes. Dom is upset, refuses to take cross-necklace back because it makes him sad, so Han holds on to it. \r\n\r\nIn the fifth film this Giselle girl shows up and is a romantic interest for Dom. He starts to fall in love with her but she turns out to be a double agent who betrays him. However she does legitimately like Dom and feels bad about breaking his heart. She runs into some karma head-on and dies, but Dom doesn’t quite hate her. Thinking about her just makes him sad.  However Letty shows up in the sixth film to save Dom from heartbreak and danger. We learn that she escaped her car crash but wandered off due to amnesia. She remembers nothing but is still drawn to Dom and Dom is in love again. She is still really good at driving cars.\r\n\r\nThroughout the series, Brian gets into some serious trouble with his adrenaline junkie ways. He learns some martial arts while in Tokyo, because in 7 he has some serious moves that I don\'t think are taught in the police academy. His relationship with Mia is tested and almost broken when he refuses to give up the heist-life, but they hold fucking strong. Only the news that he’s gonna be a daddy can reel him in from self-destruction and save their relationship. He then quits the thug life, too.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth film, this Owen Shaw dude shows up and the feds need help to stop him. Hobb assists Dom and the gang again. Owen Shaw gets ahold of a tank (which is mentioned by Roman) and the gang battle the tank using their fast cars. Hobbs totally pwns the tank with a rocket launcher or something and Shaw gets caught in the flaming wreckage, crippling him and pissing off his brother Jason Statham. Statham goes to the hospital to see his brother and so begins Furious 7. \r\n\r\nDid I nail it?\r\n','Isn\'t It Romantic',1471,281,'2016-12-18 17:08:45'),('5j5nfc','Donnie Darko: the missing link between Spielberg, King and Stranger Things','','Missing Link',0,0,'2016-12-19 05:04:43'),('5j6s97','Box Office Week: Rogue One debuts to an amazing $155 mil domestic and $290 mil worldwide, the 12th highest domestic weekend opening and the 2nd highest December opening.

Yes while **Rogue One: A Star Wars Story** was far from a total risk, it was sill interesting going in to see if Lucasfilm/Disney could keep the Star Wars brand popular outside of the Skywalker clan. Turns out they can as Rogue One rode it\'s non-scroll having, no Jedi featuring self to an amazing $155 mil domestic and $290 mil worldwide premiere weekend. So first up records. Rogue One isn\'t number 1 on any major records but it does have a few key distinctions. It\'s the 2nd highest December release of all time (behind The Force Awakens but still $70 mil above #3 spot The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey), the 12th highest grossing domestic weekend, the 21st highest grossing worldwide weekend, and is already the 15th highest domestic grossing film of the year domestic in just 3 days. So yes while normally a $100 mil downshift in opening weekends would be considered the biggest disaster of all time but of course we know that TFA\'s success was unparalleled, beating the all-time opening weekend record by $50 mil and the December opening weekend record by almost triple. So now that Rogue One has opened great, now the real test begins. A lot of concern has been laid on the film and its ability to be a viable longtail entry in December. With a much darker tone than TFA, more violent imagery, and overall lower rated reviews one could worry that other films could pick away at this success and decrease the repeat viewings that made TFA so unbelievably popular. However the film does have an A on Cinemascore so maybe audiences are more accepting of this film than expected. However unlike TFA, Hollywood this year seems to think it can compete directly with Star Wars as it has four major wide releases schedule for next holiday weekend including Passengers (a major A-list vehicle), Assassin\'s Creed (a major video game franchise adaptation), Why Him? (a R-rated comedy clearly trying to get the same holiday bump that last year\'s Daddy\'s Home had), and Sing (latest animated film from marketing geniuses Illumination). That\'s a lot of competition so Rogue One could be looking at a huge drop next weekend, or it could maintain. One thing is certain, Disney have been the king\'s of the domestic box office this year so I can see Rogue One cutting through those obstacles. The other thing to look out for is of course foreign. While the foreign take for TFA was clearly good (it made $1 bil overseas for god\'s sake), it definitely didn\'t deliver the same mega success it got in places like Germany and The UK in Asian countries like China and Japan. Clearly in terms of China, Rogue One is hoping to get a little extra from the casting of Donnie Yen, one of their biggest stars. But with The Great Wall conquering the market one wonders if there\'s room right now for Rogue One in that slate. Still Rogue One has proven that there\'s still a big market for Star Wars out there so don\'t think this yearly Star Wars thing is going to end any time soon. \r\n\r\n* Oh Will Smith, what happened to you man? From king of the box office to being in one of the most hated movies of the year as Will Smith\'s latest bomb **Collateral Beauty** is now his biggest, opening at #4 with $7 mil, the lowest wide release opening ever for Will Smith. The film, a clear Oscar bait contender, was horribly savaged by critics before release. Normally I don\'t blame the critics for a poorly reviewed movie flopping but if there\'s one thing we\'ve learned this year from movies like Billy Lynn\'s Long Halftime Walk and Miss Sloane, it\'s that Oscar plays with no buzz have zero traction whatsoever in the marketplace. [Deadline wrote a great article about Collateral Beauty](http://deadline.com/2016/12/will-smith-collateral-beauty-lowest-box-office-opening-rotten-tomatoes-1201873153/) and while I disagree with the tone of it, I do think it\'s interesting that WB had a pretty well received movie on their hands that failed so badly. Of course outside of critics there\'s the infamous bait-and-switch trailers which have been extremely blasted by critics and film fans, however they don\'t even seem to be a big factor on general audiences as Cinemascore rated this film with an A-. Perhaps the most interesting film to compare this to is Seven Pounds, another weepy Oscar never-was starring Will Smith that also got extremely negative reviews yet went on to make $156 mil worldwide. So why did Seven Pounds succeed but Collateral Beauty might not even pass its $36 mil budget? Well it seems clear that the era of the A-lister may well be over (at least with Will Smith it is). Now I think we have to look  very closely at another movie with bait-and-switch ads with horrible reviews and an A-list cast coming out next week, Passengers. If the new hot commodities of J Law and Pratt can\'t save a horribly reviewed major film on star power alone then it could be the power of the critic and word of mouth is more powerful than I thought. \r\n\r\n* Oscar update time as **Manchester by the Sea** passed Arrival and Doctor Strange to be #6 this week with $4.1 mil. As the film continues to be the front runner for Best Actor, it added 800 theaters which boosted it 31%. However it seems like **La La Land** is just waiting to burst that bubble as in just 200 theaters the film managed to come in just under Manchester with $4 mil at #7. This marks an amazing $20,100 per theater average, a remarkable feat for a film in over 150 theaters. Right now it seems like the plan is to roll out the film to maybe 200 - 300 more theaters for Christmas weekend then go wide the following weekend. This would put it in prime contention to soak up all the awards buzz it\'s getting and as the current front-runner for Best Picture and a fun musical boot I wouldn\'t be surprised if La La Land is our first true hit Best Picture winner in a while. Finally the new Oscar contender this week to open tiny is **Fences**, the Denzel Washington directed/starring drama based on the famed August Wilson play. The film opened to $128,000 on 4 theaters, giving it a per theater average of $32,000 which was probably mostly lead on the performance by Viola Davis which is now the shoe-in for Best Supporting. \r\n\r\n* While the casting of Matt Damon in **The Great Wall** caused a lot of controversy in the West, it seems China loved the choice as the film opened there to $67.4 mil on its opening weekend. The film directed by Zhang Yimou is the most expensive Chinese film of all time with a budget of $135 mil and is clearly hoping to become the first Chinese film to be a major hit at home and in the US. At least on the Chinese side this is coming true as the film has had one of the best premieres of the year and with Chinese films being more highly prioritized in that country, expect the film to break even before even arriving on the US shores. As for if the film will be a success here in the US, that is much harder to say. It\'s being released wide in February with not too stiff of competition so it could very well work, but with a pretty bland marketing campaign for the US it could easily falter. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

I mean yeah I did say that video games are in the same category of entertainment with movies and novels but unlike video games .Movies and novels are use to tell straight storytelling to the audience, Video games don’t because they storytelling is mixed and their purpose for  the player is for them to be the characters and to be interactive. All Hollywood does is adapt video games into movies and make audience hate them and need to earn money I mean they do it for a living. It’s like the filmmakers make a lousy fan fiction on the video games based on their experience playing it and made it into a movie which audience don’t like.\r\n\r\nAll video games want for its purpose is to play and not to be adapted as movies\r\n\r\nI wish Hollywood should give up this practice and never adapt video games into movies ever again, At least Japan filmmaking did a good job of adapting video games into films, right?\r\n','Wish Dragon',0,24,'2016-12-21 09:28:31'),('5jyc73','The Prodigy (2005): Has anyone seen this really good indie action film?','','The Prodigy',1,0,'2016-12-23 12:46:03'),('5k00ex','I decided to paint some of my favorite Christmas movie scenes this last week','','Last Christmas',213,30,'2016-12-23 18:11:23'),('5kbl7f','The Hustler (1961), Paul Newman in his prime.

People expect them to be bad. You have to navigate the very tricky problem of capturing what makes the game popular while facing the fact that Video Games and Movies are two *very* different mediums. And it’s probably a bad idea to alienate the fans that made the game popular in the first place while you’re at it.\r\n\r\nBut people keep making them. Not that anyone can blame them. After all, if someone really did figure out how to actually crack the code, there’d no doubt be massive rewards to be had. And honestly, it’s not like video game movies are a sure-fire failure, either. The original Tomb Raider got a sequel, and it’s hard to imagine that they’d keep making Resident Evil movies if they were a string of flops.\r\n\r\n2016 saw four major Video Game movie releases, the results of which can be said to be a mixed bag, at best.\r\n\r\nNote that I’m not trying to say this as any type of voice of authority; this is mostly based on my perception of things; I welcome any comments that correct my imperceptions and help set the record straight (or back up what I have to say) – *as long as they’re done in a constructive manner rather than tearing in to me with meaningless insults and accusations that accomplish nothing*.\r\n\r\n**Ratchet & Clank**\r\n\r\nForget there even *was* a Ratchet & Clank movie released this year? If so, I wouldn’t blame you or be surprised, because while it wasn’t completely lacking for marketing, this is movie that’s pretty dang forgettable. I wouldn’t be surprised if it came and went with most moviegoers completely missing the fact that it even existed in the first place. (*I, personally, have not seen this movie, nor have I played any of the games in the series. For that matter, my direct play experience with all four video game movies this year is minimal.*)\r\n\r\n*On paper*, Ratchet & Clank would *seem* to have just about everything going for it you could hope for in a Video Game adaptation – direct involvement from the company behind the original game series in about every way you could probably hope for, voice actors reprising their roles from the games, and practically a shoestring budget of $20 million – meaning that the movie didn’t *have* to do huge numbers to be a genuine success. Bonus point for having a movie that looked half-way decent, certainly better than the animated punchline known as Norm of the North, which cost roughly $18 million. For additional comparison, the original Toy Story is listed at costing roughly $30 million (in 1995 dollars).\r\n\r\nThe bad news? Even on a budget of merely $20 million, it couldn’t even make *that much* back. No, poor Ratchet & Clank made a pitiful *$13 million*. And remember that previous comparison to Norm of the North? Yeah, that movie somehow managed to make about $27 and a half million. And Ratchet & Clank didn’t do well with critics either, with only 12 out of the 68 pro critics giving it a go ahead (the RT Audience score? Better, but not by much at 45% approval).\r\n\r\nWhatever Ratchet & Clank supposedly did right? It clearly did something very, *very* wrong.\r\n\r\n**The Angry Birds Movie**\r\n\r\nOn the flip side of things is one the years two *arguable* successes, and probably the one that that was probably least expected to get there. (*For the record, while I’ve never played an Angry Birds game, I did, in fact, watch this one in theaters.*)\r\n\r\nYes, I’m talking about The Angry Birds Movie, the movie based on the mobile app game that has as much of an excuse plot as your typical Super Mario Brothers game, which pretty much boils down to “Your eggs have been kidnapped by pigs! Are you an Angry enough Bird to break some $#*^ and rescue them?”.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the movie still managed to turn out halfway decent, made nearly three and half hundred million in theaters on about a $73 million budget, and while only scoring a 43% with Pro Critics at RT, still managed to be the best reviewed video game movie of the year (*which just goes to show you how low the bar is for video game movies*.)\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this movie clearly did something right, and may be another example that can be pointed at for future video game adaptations as the reason why they keep making them. After all, they’re not all doomed to complete failure.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, *there is a catch*. A *very big catch*. See, if Wikipedia is to be believed (let’s just assume it is for a moment), while the movie only cost $73 to *make*? There was apparently another *$300 million* added on the back end for marketing. Suddenly, that three and half million haul isn’t looking so impressive. In fact, it would be debatable if this movie was actually a success at all, or even if it truly broke even at all (not taking into account after-theater DVD sales).\r\n\r\nWhether that’s merely because of an over-bloated marketing budget that robbed the movie of profits it could have made otherwise, or if that massive marketing budget was the only thing keeping the movie from overcoming any negative PR – even beyond the ‘Video Game Movies are terrible’ conventional wisdom – is a matter for debate.\r\n\r\n**Warcraft**\r\n\r\nOne of the years two *big* Video Game movie juggernauts and the other arguable success of the year, but in a roundabout way. (*This is another movie I saw, and while I’m not unfamiliar with the Warcraft franchise, it’s all pretty much second hand; I’ve hardly ever touched any of the actual games. Personal opinion is that while I get a lot of the complaints made about the movie, I thought it was decent overall. Not great, but decent, decent enough that I’d be open to seeing a sequel if it ever gets made.*)\r\n\r\nRegardless of its status of a Video Game movie, Warcraft undoubtedly *is* a reason why the United States is not the end-all-and-be-all of box office sales and why, regardless of your feelings about China or your opinions on Hollywood and its relationship with the “People’s Republic”, it remains an important movie market.\r\n\r\nBecause on the one hand? If you’re looking just at the domestic US market? Warcraft was nothing short of a flop. On a $160 Million budget the thing brought in less than $50 million in the United States. Which is even worse given the undoubtedly large marketing campaign it had going for it and (despite its flaws) how much effort and care went into trying to make as good a Warcraft movie as possible. Because if nothing else, the movie *looks* really, really good (seriously, it’s impressive how well they pulled off dem orcs). Plus there’s the massive controversy I’ve heard about by fans over if it’s the best adaptation we could have gotten of the universe on the big screen or if it did nothing but ruin the universe in the translation process.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was the bad critic reviews, maybe it was Warcraft having a negative perception in the minds of the general public or just not being that popular in the US, maybe it just got hit *hard* by the perception of video game movies being terrible by default, but Warcraft just didn’t click in its home country.\r\n\r\nEnter China, who are probably the people you’ll have most to thank if you’re eagerly awaiting a second Warcraft movie and it actually gets made. Whatever lack of reception the movie got in the US, China made up for it in spades, giving it over half its $433 and a half million haul.\r\n\r\nIt’s possible word has been release elsewhere, but to my knowledge, while there’s been rumors and small talk about a potential sequel, it’s yet to be seen if China’s efforts were enough to give the Warcraft universe another go on the big screen and – by extension – if the US might be willing to give the world of Warcraft a second look if given the chance.\r\n\r\n**Assassin’s Creed**\r\n\r\nIt may be too early to make full judgment on Assassin’s Creed since it only been out a weekend and still in theaters, but given that it was practically *assassinated* from its overall reception and the opening weekend numbers? Making a preliminary assessment is probably a safe bet. (*For the record – on last time – I didn’t see this movie, and I’ve neither played any of the Assassin’s Creed games nor am I fan of the franchise in any way.*)\r\n\r\nAssassin’s Creed is one of the two ‘big’ video game movie releases of the year alongside Warcraft, and like the earlier release its reception hasn’t exactly been welcoming. With a listed budget of $125 Million (which doesn’t take into account any marketing costs and beyond), as of the 26th of December the movie has managed to pull in…a mere $17 million (*Poor Ratchet and Clank can shed another tear here for not making even that much in its entire run*).\r\n\r\nI don’t know if there’s word on future foreign releases, but that is *not* a good starting point for a movie that’s as big as Assassin’s Creed is supposed to be (and one doesn’t spend $125 Million on a movie that’s not supposed to be big). With the much better received Rouge One likely to go strong for at least the next few weeks, there’s likely not much room for Assassin’s Creed to pick up space and make up its lost opening momentum. It’s certainly going to make the original plans for this being the start of an entire *franchise* much more difficult to take seriously.\r\n\r\nIf there’s one thing that Assassin’s Creed may serve to highlight, it’s a reminder of the inherent differences between video games and other, far-less-interactive mediums. I’m not under the impression that people play Assassin’s Creed for their plots about DNA memory and ancient conspiracies fighting over free will and other silly nonsense like that. What makes Assassin’s Creed interesting is getting to play as an awesome assassin who parkours their way though interesting historical settings, acting as a mad skills ninja murder machine, all the while getting called a world-saving hero for doing it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet – again highlighting one of the problems of adapting video games and the importance of remembering what makes them entertaining – the people behind Assassin’s Creed seemingly decided that somehow, the ‘excuse plot’ that the games came up with to justify the parts where you play as a mad skills ninja murder machine, the stuff involving silly DNA memories where you play as a regular joe, somehow *that* was the interesting, important part that deserved to be the focus of a movie.\r\n\r\n[An excuse plot that, as one reviewer pointed out, were eventually recognized to be so unnecessary that the games effectively did away with in favor of focusing on the parts where you play as a mad skills ninja murder machine.](http://www.markreviewsmovies.com/reviews/A/assassinscreed.htm) (*anyone out there with more familiarity with the games able to confirm or deny this to be the case?*) Feels like a major miss when, if the series the movie is adapted from recognizes it’s an element best left out, the people adapting the movie turn around and think it’s an important element that needs to be emphasized.','The Angry Birds Movie 2',4,2,'2016-12-26 12:53:11'),('5kq8fe','Any good Jim Carrey movies worth watching?','First off, I am a major fan of Jim Carrey for he is my first favourite comedian since he is basically a living cartoon character.

The directing comes to be nearly flawless, the choreography is incredible. The movie knocks it out of the park from a technical standpoint. \r\n\r\nWhat I want to talk about is the story.\r\n\r\nLa La Land is, at its core, a basic love story, probably most akin to a musical rom-com. The thing that sets La La Land apart from the rom-coms I\'m used to suffering through for my girlfriend\'s sake is the fact that it\'s unexpected. Each moment in La La Land takes you in a direction that breaks the basic romantic-film structure.\r\n\r\nThe characters in La La Land feel real because they *are* real. They make real choices. At every cliche moment, at every point where I thought I could perfectly predict what would happen based on seeing any other rom-com, La La Land took a hard left turn.\r\n\r\nSebastian stays at the Rialto Theatre even after Mia doesn\'t show up. Every other rom-com would have had him leave in a huff and create a conflict for the characters. What\'s more, he buys himself a ticket and goes in to wait for her. He isn\'t mad or upset that she was late, he was just happy she was there. \r\n\r\nHe chooses to do something he doesn\'t want to because he thinks it will make her happy (joining the band). He chooses the band\'s photoshoot over her play because he thinks it\'s more important that he\'s in the band. He supports her. He\'s real.\r\n\r\nMia finds Sebastian\'s eccentricities endearing instead of off-putting. She screws with him by requesting a joke song at the pool party. The first time they meet isn\'t romantic, he honks at her and flips her off, and yet that becomes one of the signature bits of their relationship. \r\n\r\nIn the end, La La Land shows us the movie people paid for. The movie we thought we were seeing. The cutesy love story with one conflict and characters that learn something about themselves in order to end up together.

You can check the list out on my website [here](http://www.edgarreviews.co.uk/top-20-films-of-2016-20-11/) or read on, it\'s up to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**20. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping**\r\n\r\n\r\n2016 has been a fantastic year for comedy. Sure, we’ve had the odd Bad Santa 2, but we also had Neighbours 2, and despite being savaged by critics, I thought both Grimsby and Zoolander 2 were hilarious. And another reason for this brilliant comedic year comes in the form of Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, detailing the rise and inevitable fall of ‘Conner4Real’ (Andy Samberg) following his break-up from a previous boyband. It’s a satirical riff on celebrity culture and egotism, acted and directed by The Lonely Island, a trio of comedy-musicians that became internet sensations with such nuanced work as Jizz in My Pants. So the humour is vulgar and immature, right? Well, yes, while also being both clever and hilarious. Popstar‘s true feat is that, in the face of dick jokes and Seal getting attacked by a pack of wolves, it manages to craft an emotionally rewarding and satisfying tale of friendship. No, seriously.  Despite the laugh-a-minute approach of the film, there’s genuine heart to be found, the film finding an impressive balance between the crude, the cutting, and the charming.\r\n\r\n\r\n**19. The Neon Demon**\r\n\r\n\r\nNicolas Winding Refn’s previous two films, Drive and Only God Forgives, are two of my favourite films of this decade. The Neon Demon may not reach those heights, but it certainly maintains Refn’s penchant for bloody violence and stylish set-pieces. Following model-in-training Jesse as she rises up the ranks of the fashion industry, the film explores beauty standards, vanity and jealousy, the shelf-life of models and their bloodthirsty pursuit of obtaining youth, and, er, occults. It’s a hodgepodge of venomous and surreal ideas gloriously realised by Natasha Braier’s glitzy cinematography and Cliff Martinez’s electrifying score. The film glides along with an underlying sense of dread before veering off in a totally unexpected manner that ramps up the shock factor – unexpected even when considering Refn’s track record. And the shock factor has a place rather than used just for the sake of it, propelling and fleshing out Refn’s deranged method of symbolism and meaning. The Neon Demon makes it very clear, in gloriously polished fashion, that beauty is ugly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**18. Kubo and the Two Strings**\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimation company Laika have found a niche in making grotesque and unsettling flicks palatable for a younger audience. Each of their films – from Coraline to Paranorman deal with mature themes in a careful and inspiring manner, often integrating creepy set-production and character design that would give even an older audience the jitters, and Kubo and the Two Strings is no different. Kubo focuses on loss and how it provokes the titular character to fulfil a quest very similar to a story he tells the village-folk as a way of busking. It’s a sweet, sentimental story that’s involving enough. But in truth, the story only serves as a vehicle for the film’s greatest strength: it’s wonderful animation. Astonishingly hand-crafted rather than digital, there hasn’t been a more beautiful stop-motion animation in the history of cinema (though a film appearing higher up on this list does run it close). As Kubo and his oddball sidekicks journey through caves and deep in the ocean, we are introduced to a wide variety of eye-popping visuals. Elevated by an impressive, suitably-strumming score, Kubo is an absolute joy to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n**17. Paterson**\r\n\r\n\r\nPaterson is a story about a man called Paterson who lives in Paterson, who’s a bus driver played by Adam Driver. This is fitting – the film takes on a subtly surreal tone where everything Paterson does seems to fit in place with a prior event: A painting of a waterfall, the name of a poet. A more appropriate way of describing Paterson would be that it’s less of a story and more an ordinary segment of his life, following Driver’s character for a week, fixating on his routine. He’s an aspiring poet, an affectionate boyfriend, an inquisitive bus-driver. There’s nothing much more to the film; much like Boyhood, the film revels in its delightful simplicity, rather than opting to manufacture drama. The film’s not heart-pulsing or action-packed, nor does it have to be – the camera lingering on a matchbox or eavesdropping on a conversation between two passengers is riveting enough. The film is simply a lovely two hours of cinema that functions as an ode to the creative mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n**16. Spotlight**\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year’s Best Picture winner, Spotlight, crept up on us. With The Revenant expected to be awarded the prize, Spotlight began picking up awards at an increasing pace, until it was thrust into the, er, spotlight (sorry), and received the attention that it deserves. Likewise, the film itself is an unassuming investigative piece that creeps up on you, shedding light on paedophilia in the church and how knowledge of it was hushed and swept under the rug rather than condemned. Unlike this year’s The Club, Spotlight takes a less personal approach and a more objective viewpoint, allowing the audience to develop their own sentiments of rage and indignation. Aside from fumbling a fleeting moment of outburst from Mark Ruffalo’s journalist, the film isn’t showy or heavy-handed. While its nearest competitor, The Revenant, was praised for sweeping camera movements and sumptuous visual effects, there’s nothing of the sort on display here. Rather, Spotlight adopts a minimalist approach, the camera held steady and the score barely noticeable. In that sense, it’s technically perfect: it allows a potent script and believable acting to flourish, leaving the audience with a devastating ending without drawing attention to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n**15. Victoria**\r\n\r\n\r\nVictoria is a 140-minute thriller in which its central protagonist, played wonderfully by Laia Costa, inadvertently involves herself in a robbery after a harmless night of clubbing, drinking, and smoking. The snag? It’s a single take. This obstacle doesn’t prevent Victoria from managing high ambitions, however. We follow the titular character as she joins a group of four men, talks philosophy, plays the piano, takes part in a robbery and outruns the police, all in one take. The method of filming doesn’t mask the grittiness of the situation, and provides realism and panic to stakes that we as an audience are engaged by. The film is deeply emotional, impressively action-packed, daring, unpredictable you name it. Its cinematography leads us to believe that these are real people, stuck in a real situation, and their plight is one we should be interested in, and, inevitably, devastated by.\r\n\r\n\r\n**14. The Big Short**\r\n\r\n\r\nOn paper, a movie about banks is tricky business. The problem is that nobody in their right minds should care: it’s all adjustable-rate mortgages and collateralised debt organisations. However, Adam McKay, director of Anchorman, makes it look easy, birthing a film about the housing market collapse of the mid 2000s that’s not only interesting and informative, tinged with McKay’s impressive knack for eking out humour, but also ferocious in its criticism of the banking industry. Make no mistake, the slick self-aware explanations of financial jargon and the knowingly-cheesy fourth wall breaks are all bells and whistles for a serious, cutting film imbued with a political current. There’s no mistaking the fact that the final few moments of the film provide anger rather than relief, solemnity rather than celebration. It’s a study on morally grey characters: their profit is a huge amount of people’s loss, and McKay’s greatest trick is to stir the audience into celebrating along with them before realising the significance of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**13. Under the Shadow**\r\n\r\n\r\n2016’s most downright terrifying film of the year goes to Under the Shadow, an Iranian-language horror with a disturbing threat that may or may not exist in the form of a Djinn. There’s a sociopolitical undercurrent to the events taking place: Narges Rashidi’s Shadeh, the central character to the film, is seen fleeing from her apartment with her daughter. Rather than being consoled, she is arrested for not covering herself up. It is made clear that Shadeh not only has to face the horrors haunting her apartment, but the horrors of the outside world. Yet these themes of sexism and intolerance in religion don’t overcrowd the simple, calculated story at the heart of Under the Shadow. Supernatural happenings occur, and with the introduction of a few marvellously unsettling dream sequences, the camera swaying with Shadeh’s movement, it’s not made immediately apparent whether the Djinn is tangible or simply a fiction created by Shadeh’s insomniac-ridden mind. Under the Shadow functions beautifully on many levels: as a statement on Iran’s sociopolitical climate, as an ode to their mythology, and as an intensely frightening horror story.\r\n\r\n\r\n**12. The Nice Guys**\r\n\r\n\r\nShane Black is gradually becoming one of my go-to directors for comedy. 2013’s Iron Man 3 is my favourite movie from the Marvel Universe, and that’s because it was a comedy begging to not being taken seriously, with a comedic twist worth the ticket price alone. The Nice Guys maintains its director’s sense of riotous fun with a 70s detective caper, lead by the duo of Russell Crowe’s straight-faced Jackson and Ryan Gosling’s endearingly clueless Holland. It’s a supremely enjoyable and stylish pastiche of the 70s, complete with cheesy afros and funky house parties. There’s little discernible substance, and the film acknowledges the lack of harm the two characters go through, Gosling stating his own invincibility amid a flurry of gunfire, but there’s enormous amusement to be had listening to the protagonist’s Ritchie-esque banter and watching as they faff their way through a rather serious investigation. It’s the year’s best definitive comedy, in a year full of great comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n**11. The Revenant**\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile The Neon Demon argues that there’s ugliness in beauty, The Revenant argues that there’s beauty to be found in ugliness. At least, that’s what the film’s cinematography suggests, often giving the appearance of a nature documentary rather than one man’s (Leonardo DiCaprio) cold-blooded tale of survival and revenge. It’s brutal film-making, realised in high definition, orchestrated with panoramic camera movements that capture blood, dirt and snow in all its gritty detail. Interspersed with floaty dream sequences, the film is elevated beyond a simple revenge tale to a study on the concept of revenge itself, the morality behind the actions you take in order to pursue it, and the marvels of human endurance. The Revenant is a visceral, spiritual journey supported by stirring performances, an unsparing tone and its juxtaposing, visually arresting imagery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this list, please feel free to check out my website to see more/help me out with views :) http://www.edgarreviews.co.uk/','Cold Pursuit',9,10,'2017-01-03 18:43:40'),('5ly2m0','All the films that I watched during the year of 2016, what do you think?','2016 film list\r\n\r\nThe Revenant \r\nThe King\'s Speech\r\nReservoir Dogs\r\nSherlock The Abominable Bride\r\nMacbeth\r\nDeadpool\r\nGods of Egypt\r\nThe Giver\r\nSpotlight\r\nDallas Buyers Club\r\nSelma\r\nThe Social Network\r\nLondon Has Fallen\r\nPoint Break (2015)\r\nBatman v Superman Dawn of Justice\r\nThe Jungle Book\r\nCaptain America Civil War\r\nSucker Punch\r\nX-Men Apocalypse \r\nThe Guest\r\nCentral Intelligence \r\nEverest\r\nThe Legend of Tarzan\r\nStar Trek Beyond \r\nThe Big Short\r\nJason Bourne\r\nSuicide Squad\r\nThe Great Escape\r\nWarcraft \r\nThe Green Mile\r\nThe Nice Guys\r\n10 Cloverfield Lane\r\nThe Huntsman Winter\'s War\r\nA Hologram for the King\r\nBastille Day\r\nMidnight Special \r\nNow You See Me 2\r\nKilling Them Softly \r\nMoonrise Kingdom\r\nTrainspotting \r\nAliens\r\nGoldeneye \r\nLincoln\r\nBridesmaids \r\nMulholland Dr.\r\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang\r\nA Clockwork Orange \r\nThe Killing Joke\r\nThe Crow\r\nSpy\r\nEternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind\r\nWar Dogs\r\nIn the Heart of the Sea\r\nNinja Turtles Out of the Shadows\r\nSnowden\r\nThe Magnificent Seven 2016\r\nDon\'t Breath\r\nGhostbusters 2016\r\nTotal Recall 1990\r\nMr.Church\r\nDr.Strange\r\nDope\r\nHacksaw Ridge\r\nNerve\r\nMe before You\r\nHell or High Water\r\nArrival \r\nSully\r\nThe Adjustments Bureau   \r\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\r\nThe Accountant\r\nStar Wars Rogue One\r\nNocturnal Animals\r\nAssassin\'s Creed\r\nThe Girl on the Train \r\n\r\n','Abominable',0,12,'2017-01-04 03:47:19'),('5mbhsx','What are your favorite action films that aren\'t given their due?','Especially those that are well-known but weren\'t critical successes.\r\n\r\nI\'d have to say my two would be U-571\"\" and Brendan Fraser\'s \"\"The Mummy.\"\" Neither was Academy Award material in any sense but they were a ton of fun and have great re-watchability.

The only exceptions I would consider are both the Sam Raimi and the Marc Webb Spider-Man movies. Let\'s take the Thor movies for example, the chemistry between Thor and Jane just feels so fake and it\'s so random. It feels like the filmmakers put Jane in the movie just so the protagonist needs a love interest in order progress throughout the story. When I see these two characters together, I don\'t sense a genuine feeling of intimacy between them; rather, they\'re like cardboard. I think the problem has to do with movie\'s lack of focus on the romantic aspect, which makes it spend less time on it. After all, superhero movies prioritize on the action, which explains why many people overlook the weak romance in these movies, but that\'s the problem. I think if superhero movies want to implement romance, they should do it right, or don\'t even add it at all. This problem isn\'t only present in the Thor franchise, man of steel, bvs, iron man, guardians of the galaxy, captain America, you name it.

And who hasn\'t loved the trailers for the sequel? And they got Kurt Russel to play a planet. Perfect.\r\n\r\nWonder Woman. I\'m kind of shocked that this is the first Wonder Woman movie considering she is the most popular female superhero. But anyways, the WW Comic Con trailer was the best trailer that came out of Comic Con. It has the director of Monster and Gal Gadot (Who was a highlight in Batman V Superman) returning as Wonder Woman.\r\n\r\nCaptain Underpants. I read these books when I was a little kid, but I\'m not sure if this will work as a movie. I need to see a trailer to find out what they are going for. I hope this film surprises us the way Cloudy With A Chance Meatballs did. And this film also has my celebrity crush Kristen Schaal.\r\n\r\nTransformers The Last Knight. Oh boy. The first Transformers film was an okay action film, however the second one was a giant bag of garbage, the third one was a snooze fest, and the fourth one was a steaming hot mess. I don\'t have a lot of hope for Transformers 5. Why are they adding Merlin, King Arthur, and Nazis in a Transformers movie?\r\n\r\nSpider-Man Homecoming. You can probably tell this by my username, but Spider-Man is my hero. I love him to death. And I loved Tom Holland\'s Spider-Man in Civil War and the idea of Homecoming being a high school coming of age film and that Birdman is playing Vulture. But I didn\'t love the trailer for Homecoming. I have concerns of it not feeling like a Spidey film and having to many MCU tie ins/cameos. I hope I\'m wrong though and I\'m still excited.\r\n\r\nValerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets. I\'ve never read the Valerian comic, but I do know it helped influence Star Wars and I do like that Dane Dahaan is leading the film. I thought the trailer was style over substance though. I want this to be a great sci fy film and Luc Besson\'s apology for Lucy, but I\'m also concerned it will be a Jupiter Ascending like mess.\r\n\r\nKingsman The Golden Circle. I think most people are forgetting about Kingsman 2 when they shouldn\'t. I just watched Kingsman again last night and I still love it. And I\'m happy that Matthew Vaughn is coming back to direct. I\'m just wondering how they will explain Colin Firth\'s return and how they can top that church scene from the first film.\r\n\r\nThor Ragnarok. Thor and Hulk going on an intergalactic adventure together? More Loki? Dr Strange? Odin as a hobo? Cate Blanchett as the villain? Jeff Goldblum? Sign me up!\r\n\r\nJustice League. I want this to be DC\'s Avengers so bad. I have high hopes for this film because we are finally getting a Justice League film with a cool sounding story, but I\'m also a little scared of it disappointing me the same way BVS did.

Lots of stuff coming up including The reddit Top 250 voting thread, Oscar Bingo, AMA\'s, and a new season of Fantasy Movie League!

How this will work:\r\n\r\n- Sometime in the next week we will post the voting thread. Already posted in that thread will be the top 100 from last year, the best picture nominees for this year, and some favorite picks by the mods because we are gluttons for punishment and mockery. These aren\'t pre-posted to try and steer the voting, they are posted by a shared movie mods account to soak up karma so people aren\'t blasting popular choices for karma.\r\n\r\n- Once the thread is made and posted you are free to post three movies that **aren\'t already posted.** Three per user, we will remove them if you post more than that. \r\n\r\n- The thread will be sorted by top. We\'ve tried contest mode and it doesn\'t work because people just resubmit movies that have already been submitted because they don\'t want to look through the thread then votes get split. You can load as many submissions as you want and vote for as many of your favorites as you want.\r\n\r\n- Downvoting is discouraged but honestly there\'s not much we can do to stop you.\r\n\r\n- After several days of voting we will lock the thread and take it down. The votes will be counted and we will get the list made and posted. [Here\'s last year\'s list](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/reddit+top+250/). We know there\'s always a recency bias, that\'s why we do this every year.

Last year something like 25,000 cards were generated and we had a ton of fun in the game thread during the Oscars. This has probably become my favorite part of the Oscars, if you haven\'t played before you should! Here\'s how it works:\r\n\r\n- About a week and a half before the Oscars I will post a thread asking for Bingo submissions. These will be for the Bingo squares and you will submit things that might actually happen at the Oscars.\r\n\r\n- After a couple of days of submitting and voting we will lock the thread, gather the most popular (plausible) submissions, and send them to our friends at print-bingo.com who will then send us back a random bingo card generator that gives you a unique card every time!\r\n\r\n- Download your card, print it out (or not, whatever), and join us during the Game Thread that will be posted around the same time the Official Oscar Discussions thread is posted. There we will be discussing the events and making rulings on which squares have happened and which haven\'t. First three people to get a Bingo and e-mail us (e-mail will be provided in game thread) with proper proof will win some stupid movies from my personal collection!

A pivotal four weeks for them, not so much for me who has done fucking awful this season but hey I can\'t be amazing at everything. Remember, if you win I\'ll give you subreddit flair. How cool is that? Pretty cool, right?\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t know what Fantasy Movie League is now is a great time to make your account and play the last end of the season so that you\'re familiar with it when the new season starts! It\'s a simple but challenging game. Every week you have 1000 FML Bux to spend on currently playing movies to play in your theater. You can play the same movie more than once or leave screens blank. The players who collect the most box office intake (domestically speaking) within the given budget win the week, and your totals add up every week so being in the top 10 at the end of the season is quite a feat!\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like to play just follow this link:\r\n\r\nhttps://fantasymovieleague.com/group/3185?statType=season\r\n\r\nMake an account, and join the league.

Also, let me say from the outset that this was a very good film and that I also recognize that in creating a movie there are limits in how to build the story that may play a negative role in some of my interpretations.\r\n\r\n1. The incident in the market where he tries to buy the pork chops seems a bit contrived in how it plays out. In a previous scene, the manager told the son he and his father were not welcome to shop there. Yet, there he is shopping in the store. Now, maybe the son never tells the Dad about this incident so he doesn’t know. But wouldn’t they have told him to leave once he entered the store as the whole town knows about it. Also, this is a small town where everybody knows everybody so it seems strange the butcher wouldn’t know him. Then, the confrontation itself seems odd. The butcher is ok with him picking up various groceries but the point of no return is when he asks for some meat. It seems strange if the butcher is aware of the manager not allowing him in the store. It would only make sense if the butcher was told it was ok for him to shop in the store or the butcher did know he could shop in the store or not and was simply drawing his line in the sand at his butcher’s station. That being said, this scene was one of the strongest in the movie especially when he goes back in the store to headbutt the guy. The whole scene seemed very real with the battling of emotions of fight or flight and standing up for oneself.\r\n\r\n2. I felt the church scene was one of the strongest scenes of the movie. I have mixed feelings on what was his motivation to go to the church. I feel part of it was his stubbornness to prove publicly that he was not guilty of the claims and wanted to show he had every right to be there before God and everyone. However, another part of me feels he was simply going there to seek a healing and vindication from God and to a lesser extent maybe the community. For he would know that God knew the truth and felt hearing God’s words in the service would help him especially after having to bury his dog who is his real devoted companion in the movie. And everything goes fine as he looks back at his friend proving to himself that I belong here and hearing the words of the priest that all are welcome. But then the scene changes when the children come in to sing and he is forced to confront the injustice against him again. Suddenly, it is no longer enough to just be there and his healing is ruined and he feels the need to confront his friend and proclaim his innocence.\r\n\r\n3. I am having trouble with his acceptance of his friends and even Klara toward the end of the film after people start to believe he is innocent. I don’t believe one could be so forgiving. People have focused so much on how the community will never be able to fully accept him but I think that would be a two way street because he would know these folks betrayed him. I don’t think you can get over that. It is like a broken vase that even though it is glued back together again it still knows it was broken and who broke it. The scene with Klara seems too unbelievable to me. I don’t think he would put himself in that situation where he was in a room alone with her again and certainly not pick her up without others present. I think it would be far more likely you would see some detachment on his part towards the folks and you saw non of it.\r\n\r\n4. Another interesting aspect to the film was he never chose to call on the police about the various incidents of them killing his dog and throwing a rock through his window nor to call the police about the incident at the market. I don’t know if this was part of the masculine theme of the hunt or maybe he would feel it would not help his situation. But throughout the film he played the civilized man yet chose to address these situations in a more primal way rather than calling on the police which would be arguably the more civilized approach. But perhaps this is a more Danish small town way of handling things like this.\r\n\r\nI would also add to see if others had a similar feeling about this film. I knew this film had received good reviews yet I put off watching it for a long time because of the subject matter. I was fearful that I would not like seeing the witch hunt. I wonder if I am alone on this.','The Hunt',3,0,'2017-02-05 12:49:17'),('5skpem','Matthew McConaughey to Star in Harmony Korine’s ‘The Beach Bum’','','The Beach Bum',10,9,'2017-02-07 05:40:33'),('5slyqh','Matthew McConaughey Boards ‘The Beach Bum’ From ‘Spring Breakers’ Helmer Harmony Korine','','The Beach Bum',28,13,'2017-02-07 10:24:00'),('5smwak','Dwayne Johnson, Stephen Merchant & WWE Studios Team For Wrestling Pic ‘Fighting With My Family’','','Fighting with My Family',0,1,'2017-02-07 12:55:32'),('5sn8f1','Jennifer Connelly Joins James Cameron\'s \'Alita: Battle Angel\'','','Alita: Battle Angel',198,57,'2017-02-07 13:46:35'),('5sv811','Disney’s Live-Action ‘Aladdin’ Won’t Be ‘Prince of Persia’, Says Producer; Promises Diverse Cast','','Aladdin',371,308,'2017-02-08 15:20:31'),('5swpuq','Lena Headey, Nick Frost Joins Dwayne Johnson In ‘Fighting With My Family’ Wrestling Pic.','','Fighting with My Family',2,0,'2017-02-08 19:30:04'),('5t8ikr','‘Dumbo’ A No Go For Will Smith','','Dumbo',90,68,'2017-02-10 12:13:52'),('5t94y3','I\'m looking for movies like Alien and Serenity where space travel has become routine and boring.','I\'m looking for movies like Aliens and Serenity where space travel has become routine and boring.

However, if Hugh and Amir had spoken up, could the group have realized at this point that there are more than two houses/realities? \r\n\r\nLet\'s recap the situation: After Mike, Em, Kevin and Laurie return, we have Mike1, Em1, Kevin1, Laurie1; Beth2, Lee2; Amir3, Hugh3 (see link at the top). Group 1 and 2 believe they are from the same house; Group 3 knows it\'s in the wrong house because of the glow sticks: Amir and Hugh think red is the \'right\' color, not blue. So from the Amir and Hugh\'s point of view we know we have 2 distinct groups (in reality we have 3). \r\n\r\n\r\nNow the part I\'m not sure about: Do Amir and Hugh believe they are from the other house and only one other house exists (I think yes)? And if so, could they have cast doubt on this theory by speaking up? My argument is: The other house has the red glowsticks, just like Amir and Hugh. But how would they explain getting to the house they are in right now (with the blue glowsticks) despite remembering they walked to the other house and back to their own house? And Mike says he saw Amir, Hugh and Lee at the other house - so \'our\' Amir and Hugh could believe they just switched places with their counterparts, but they\'d have no explanation for how that happened. \r\n\r\nSo if my reasoning is correct, the group still would have no proof that more than two realities exists, but I think they could\'ve considered this as a possibility. Because if they say the dark zone simply switched the two different Amirs and Hughs from the two different houses, then why didn\'t it switch the Mike, Em, Kevin, Laurie group (they clearly aren\'t from the other, red-glowstick-house because they remember having blue ones). Of course the counter-argument would be that a switch doesn\'t always happen. \r\n\r\nThe nail in the coffin for the two-houses-and-switch-theory would be if Em, who overhears Lee and Beth talking about the vase in the kitchen (after the argument whether Beth drugged the group), mentioned that the two already had the same discussion at the beginning of the evening. \r\n\r\nedit: I know the group raises the question I\'m describing here immediately after Hugh and Amir leave with the box and the book, but for me this post is just a fun thought-experiment.

The movie was pretty great, both Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton give great, well-rounded and extremely convincing performances. The movie follows the Loving couple from Virginia that was responsible for the SCOUS decision to ban the criminalization of inter-racial marriages. Sometimes you\'re just baffled that some laws existed, were widely accepted (15 other states has relatively similar laws at the date of the Supreme Court decision) and that it was only 50 years ago. The pace of the movie is rather slow, there\'s only the beautiful relationship between the two protagonists that is put to the test again and again by an absolutely insane law, the effects of said law and the general consensus of people around them(friends and family that did not believe that their marriage was necessary). There\'s not much else to say about the movie, I loved it and I think it should serve as a reminder that quite often regular people are captive in absurd laws and regulations. As a stray observation both Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton are not american actors, but they star in a movie about an american supreme court decision that changed laws throughout the US.\r\nI love that Michael Shannon did appear in the movie, making it 5 in a row with Jeff Nichols. At this point I haven\'t seen a Jeff Nichols movie that I did not like, be it about apocalyptic visions or US supreme courts decisions, the man knows how to bring emotion, vulnerability and has a knack of building convincing characters that are nuanced and complex.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5tmvax/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_020617/ddnmutj/)\r\n\r\n\r\n* [20th Century Women\r\nThere\'s an undercurrent of sadness in Mike Mills\' celebration of his mother.

Whether they be about [jet ski action scenes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/), [explosions on movie posters] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2013/07/15/movienomics-explosions-and-movie-posters/) or [Nicholas Sparks movies] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xj0wq/movies_adapted_from_nicholas_sparks_books_that/) I can’t help compiling data that means little in the long run. The following post examines the data of films that feature pencils used as weapons. I just watched John Wick: Chapter Two and was very impressed with the violence that John was able to inflict on his foes with a pencil. The film influenced me to gather the Rotten Tomatoes critic scores, IMDb user scores and domestic box office/budgets of pencil weapon movies in order to see how they add up. The films Gremlins 2: The New Batch, The Faculty, Evil Dead, The Dark Knight, RocknRolla, From Dusk Till Dawn, Sleeperwalkers, Fright Night and Stoker all feature some fantastic pencil work and the results were surprising.\r\n\r\n**Sidenote:** If you are looking for “pen action scene” data you are gonna have to go somewhere else. Sorry Casino, The Bourne Identity and The Running Man. Also, the films Tormented and Pencil do not have enough data to be included in the post. I didn’t include the box office of John Wick: Chapter Two because it just came out.\r\n\r\n**The Average Rotten Tomatoes Critic Score is 69.8%**\r\n\r\nI was really impressed with the “fresh” 69.8% average. My best guess as to why they are fresh is because they thought outside the box and went creative with the violence. Nobody expects pencils and the results are always surprising and cringe worthy. The fresh average was buoyed by The Dark Knight, (94) John Wick 2 (90), Evil Dead (95) and Fright Night (91). These four films carried Sleepwalkers (15), The Faculty (54), and RocknRolla (59) on their backs and gave cinematic pencil violence a good name.\r\n\r\n**The Average Budget is $47 Million**\r\n\r\n$47 million is relatively low nowadays for movies that get theatrical releases. The budgets were kept low via the horror films on the list. The Faculty, Evil Dead, Fright Night, Stoker and From Dusk Till Dawn all have budgets below $30 million. The Dark Knight and its $205 million budget are what kept the budgets in the 40s. The biggest surprise was the $92 million (with inflation) budget of Gremlins 2: The New Batch. Key and Peele were right, G2 is a crazy film and [their video is great] (https://youtu.be/x01l_jMhjVM)\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Average Inflated Domestic Box Office is $98,927,434**\r\n\r\n$98,927,434 is nothing to sneeze at. I was very impressed with the tally and it made jet ski action scene movies look bad in comparison ($49 million). The Dark Knight jacked up the average with its $593 million, but Gremlins 2, The Faculty, Fright Night and Sleepwalkers all collected over $50 million at the box office (with inflation) and helped out as well. The only film that super tanked was the very good Stoker ($1.7 million).\r\n\r\n**The Average IMDb User Score is 7.14**\r\n\r\nThe 7.14 average proves that IMDb users like pencil violence more than critics (I can’t back this up). I was surprised to see the 7.14 average because it is really quite high. The Dark Knight (9) and John Wick 2 (8.5) boosted the scores while Evil Dead (7.6), RocknRolla (7.3) and The Faculty (7.3) helped combat the lower ratings.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** These averages prove nothing of importance. However, movies that feature pencil violence easily defeated movies that feature [jet ski actions scenes] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/10/24/the-mff-podcast-75-cinematic-jet-ski-action-scenes-are-the-worst/) and that makes me happy.\r\n','It: Chapter Two',485,66,'2017-02-21 16:33:12'),('5vg3dx','Late Night with Seth Meyers had a pretty good skit about \'Oscar Bait\' films','','Late Night',118,18,'2017-02-21 21:41:03'),('5vgktf','Kyle Chandler cast in Godzilla: King of Monsters - Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters Movie News','','Godzilla: King of the Monsters',0,2,'2017-02-21 23:17:01'),('5vrpnn','Sharing Oscar Picks','Hi all, is there any way for us to share our Oscar picks on here?\r\n\r\nHere are mine for this year (I\'ve seen almost all of the movies nominated for the larger awards, except for Best Actress)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thesmartalec.org/2017/02/2017-oscars-smart-picks.html?m=1\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Picture - La La Land\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most enjoyable movie I\'ve seen in some time. I don\'t consider many movies flawless, but I\'d put this up with The Wrestler and Before Sunrise as a project executed to perfection at every dimension. From the music and acting to the chemistry and dancing, to the sheer enthusiasm the movie instilled in me, there is no way I can\'t see this winning Best Picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Director - Damien Chazelle, La La Land\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s incredible what Chazelle has already achieved so early in his career. Whiplash was incredible, but La La Land is going to be a signature movie that will be hard to top. Every interview I\'ve seen with cast and crew gives evidence to his undeniable passion for seeing this project to reality, and the respect he\'s been able to command so early in his directing career is incredible. I\'m beyond excited for what he brings next, to the level that I feel with Aronofsky and Nolan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Actor - Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year was very strong for actor performances, especially compared to last year. Casey Affleck’s performance in Manchester by the Sea exhuded a level of emotion that few best actor nominees have ever reached, in my opinion. The scene at the police station stands out as defining his performance as a shell of a man, on the brink of lost hope.\r\n\r\nA close runner up would be Denzel Washington for Fences. Fences was a film project Washington had wanted to realize for some time, having already acted in the theater performance. Fences felt like two hour play in movie form, and I mean that in the best possible way. The dialogue and delivery were some of the best I\'ve seen in some time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Actress - Emma Stone, La La Land\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma Stone was perfect for this role. Her undeniable charm, chemistry with Gosling, and range of emotion stole the show. “Audition” well characterizes this span of emotion in a single song. It\'s incredible how that song, along with “City of Stars”, were performed and recorded on set during the live take!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Supporting Actor - Mahershala Ali, Moonlight\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite being in my opinion the second best picture this year, I think Moonlight will be unfortunately sparse in terms of awards given the competition this year. However, Ali\'s performance was remarkable and stands a level above all the excellent emotion driven performances in the movie. It\'s great to see him at the Cinema after he did so well in House of Cards.\r\n\r\nMy personal runner up for this award is Issei Ogata for his role of Inoue Chikugonokami in Silence. I\'d liken his performance\'s breakthrough impact on me to that of Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds. Both were non traditional villains with humility and humor, and I hope we see more of him in American cinema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Supporting Actress - Viola Davis, Fences\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Academy counted this performance as Best Actress I still think she would have won. What a tour de force performance, especially considering the incredibly difficult script. There were a couple scenes/monologues with Viola where my jaw literally dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Animated Film - Zootopia\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a tough one for me between Zootopia and Moana. Both were excellent, but Zootopia seemed to ooze more passion through the world that was created. Moana has very few flaws and an incredible soundtrack, but Zootopia just seems to have achieved something greater in my opinion. Add that to the fact that Zootopia picked up the Golden Globe, and I think it will be hard for Moana to take this category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Original Soundtrack - La La Land\r\n\r\n\r\nSo catchy. So happy. So sad. So perfect. “Another Day of Sun” is my current feel good morning song. “Epilogue” perfectly blends the entire soundtrack together. I can\'t get enough. Thank you Justin Hurwitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Original Song - City of Stars, La La Land\r\n\r\n\r\nWho doesn\'t love a good duet? When I think of La La Land, “City of Stars” is the track that immediately starts playing in my head. It sums up the trials and tribulations of both main characters and moves from a somber opening to a powerful climax, before perfectly wrapping up the way it started. My runner up in this category is “You\'re Welcome” from Moana. I was beyond hyped for Moana once Lin-Manuel Miranda was confirmed to be contributing to the soundtrack, and this track is definitively his. Between the extremely catchy chorus, the signature Miranda rap, and the fact that this was written and pulled off amazingly by The Rock(!!), I can\'t stop listening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActor of the Year - Andrew Garfield\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, I know this isn\'t a real Academy Award. However, the actor that\'s stood out to me over the course of the year was Andrew Garfield, with his performances in Hacksaw Ridge and Silence. I had the privilege of watching Scorcese speak about the filming of Silence, and his praise for Garfield was immense. Garfield\'s humility and acting prowess are extremely impressive, and I think he deserves to be recognized for this. I\'m confident he will get an Oscar in due time if he keeps up this level of work.','Breakthrough',3,2,'2017-02-23 12:26:28'),('5vx56y','\'No one has bigger dreams\': the Hollywood gamble of Robert Evans - With The Godfather and Chinatown, Robert Evans revolutionised the movie industry.

It sets up for sequels while still maintaining a good resolution on its own, unlike some other movies. \r\n\r\nBut oh shit, Mordo becomes a bad guy? Damn. That was... sudden. I do recall Mordo being a bad guy name but I didn\'t think... not like this.

Other newcomers Rock Dog (#11, $3.7M) and Collide (#13, $1.5M) bomb. Also, Arrival has finally passed $100M domestic, and Resident Evil: The Final Chapter has surprise massive debut in China, earning $94M on opening weekend','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Get Out | $33,400,000 |  $33,400,000  | 1 |\r\n| 2 | The LEGO Batman Movie | $19,000,000 | $226,006,578 | 3 |\r\n| 3 | John Wick: Chapter Two | $9,000,000 | $125,512,700 | 3 |\r\n| 4 | The Great Wall | $8,700,000 | $300,024,800 | 2 |\r\n| 5 | Fifty Shades Darker | $7,700,400 | $328,335,615 | 3 |\r\n*all numbers are for the four-day weekend\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* Best Picture win wasn\'t the only surprise this weekend as **Get Out** almost doubled expectations to open with a fantastic $33.4 mil. In comparison the film made $13 mil more this weekend than the entire domestic run of director Jordan Peele\'s previous film he made, Keanu. The horror/satire received fantastic reviews from critics but analysts were worried a tense nation wouldn\'t want to explore those themes, with the studio and predictors place it more in the $18 mil range. Not only did the film far surpass that number, it also scored an incredible A- on Cinemascore, so any worries that the audience would reject the film seem to be quashed. For reference last year Don\'t Breathe got a B on Cinemascore and had some of the best legs ever for a horror film. You just don\'t see A- for horror, the only recent ones being the two Conjuring films and The Sixth Sense. This film also represents another incredible success for low-budget maestro Blumhouse, which saw Split doing gangbusters not more than a month earlier. With these two films Jason Blum has really stepped out of his usual comfort zone and given a lot of support to unique visions (as long as they come in perfectly on budget of course). In a time when Hollywood is struggling to figure out how to market and produce original ideas, Get Out and Split have shown that Blum is incredibly good at spotting original talent while giving a perfect buffer for the dozens of flops he makes each year you\'ve never even heard of. It\'s not just Blum who profits, as the small scale budget means Jordan Peele is going to see a significant payday from the venture and is almost guaranteed a lot more opportunities than he would have had just a week ago. While next week sees the major release of Logan, the film should still hold well with great word of mouth and counter-progamming to bigger March releases. \r\n\r\n* Did you know there was an animated movie released wide this week about a dog that wants to be a rock star? Chances are you didn\'t cause **Rock Dog** opened at #11 to a pitiful $3.7 mil. Much like last week\'s The Great Wall, this was a Chinese production that hoped to make bank in both the US and China but has failed in both. In China the film has only made $5.6 mil (though that could be due to the largest theater chain in China banning the film in their theaters to cause the film to fail for complicated financial reasons) and will likely make about the same here by the end of it. With almost no marketing the film didn\'t stand a chance and with no play whatsoever in China will be written off at a loss for sure.\r\n\r\n* Speaking of things coming out you probably didn\'t know existed, **Collide**, the latest train-wreck from Open Road films has opened to an even worse spot of #13 with $1.5 mil making it the 6th worst wide release opening weekend of all time (btw the top ten of that list now only contains films that were released in the last ten years). The thriller starring Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones was clearly a shelfjob, as it barely had a scrap of marketing and was horribly savaged by critics and audiences. This joins the esteemed list of recent Open Road flops like Sleepless, Bleed for This, and Max Steel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Get Out has an incredible 20% drop for a great weekend at #2 with $26.1M. Christian film The Shack exceeds predictions at #3 with $16.1M and teen fantasy drama Before I Fall bombs at #5 with $4.9M.','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | Logan | $88,411,916 |  $237,800,000	 | 1 |\r\n| 2 | Get Out  | $28,236,285 | $75,954,335 | 2 |\r\n| 3 | The Shack | $16,172,119| $16,100,000 | 1 |\r\n| 4 | The LEGO Batman Movie| $11,702,364 | $256,831,801	 | 4 |\r\n| 5 | John Wick: Chapter 2 | $4,804,238 | $4,948,538 | 1 |\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* I think it\'s now fair to say the success of Deadpool as a R-rated comic book movie was no fluke as **Logan** defied even high expectations and opened at #1 with ~~$85.3M~~ $88.4M. Predictions were high, but still mostly peaked around the $60M - $70M range, so the fact it surpassed 50 Shades of Grey as the 5th highest grossing R-rated domestic release is a major achievement. Even more impressive is comparing Logan to previous X-Men films. For starters this is the best premiere of the three solo Wolverine films, which is very impressive considering that it just barely squeaked past the $85M premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Okay yes that film was trashed critically but you have to remember that film was the premiere solo X-Men film coming off three megahit films and introduced (rather horribly) popular X-Men characters Gambit and Wolverine, so a movie starring only two major X-Men characters, rated R, with a dark violent tone surpassing that is quite a feat. The film is also the fifth best opening overall for an X-Men film and is just a few thousand behind X-2\'s opening and could easily surpass it when actuals come in (**edit: indeed it passed X-2\'s opening**). Logan wasn\'t just a hit domestically, as it opened to $152M overseas. That\'s the best international opening ever for an R-rated Fox film and the third best international opening ever for the company overall. This included an impressive $48M premiere in China despite the fact the cut that was shown there was heavily censored. With incredible reviews and an early push to get the film to be a consideration for next year\'s awards runs, the film has clearly shown that R-rate comic book films have an interesting place in the market. With such a success built on a film about finality (it\'s not a spoiler that this is Hugh Jackman\'s supposed final outing as the character) one wonders what lessons Hollywood and Fox can take from this film. At very least it shows audiences are willing to let the characters explore deeper themes, more adult storylines, lower stakes, and both this and Deadpool showed you can make a crazy amount of money without 3D. The legs remain to be seen (it did score an A- on Cinemascore so will likely hold well but there is stiff competition ahead) but Logan has already surpassed the odds and given a possible new direction for superhero films to consider.  \r\n\r\n* My two golden rules for box office prediction are never underestimate horror or Christian films, the latter of which was proven by the **The Shack** the adaptation of a popular faith based novel that surprised predictions by opening at #3 to a very good $16.1M. Like most Christian films The Shack was savaged by critics giving it a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences don\'t seem to care as the film scored an A on Cinemascore. This is one of the bigger new Christian film productions, being made by Lionsgate instead of an independent studio like Pure Flix and the wider marketing has likely helped surpass the expectations that placed the film around $8M opening. The film should hold well as counter-programming and will easily pass its $20M budget. \r\n\r\n* While the counter-programming worked for The Shack, it clearly did not work for **Before I Fall**, the latest Open Road films bomb which opened at ~~#5~~ #6 to $4.6M. The film, a teenage dramatic take on Groundhog\'s Day, was clearly expecting many teen girls to not be able to or interested in seeing Logan but the strategy didn\'t pay off as the film was in the top 150 worst wide release openings ever. What audiences did see the film apparently weren\'t too impressed as it only scored a B on Cinemascore. With strong teen girl competition opening in two week with Beauty and the Beast it\'s likely the film will drop significantly. Still the budget for the film was only $5M, so it wasn\'t exactly a major play from Open Road but certainly doesn\'t help their recent string of flops. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

I will highlight some.\r\n\r\n>On one of our deployments to the Med, the USS Iowa was part of the battle group we were replacing. The day both groups of ships were together off the coast of Spain, they were doing training exercises and part of that was a broadside firing from the battleship. I was on the bridge watch and was looking at her as she fired. I remember the eruption of yellow flame and black smoke that surrounded the ship. We must have been about 8 miles away and, of course, there was silence as the flames erupted. As the smoke and flame was dissipating, the sound reached us. It was so strange because of the mismatch of the visual and the sound. I remember it being a crack as though someone had snapped a gigantic tree in half, followed by a rumbling roar. Even at that distance, you almost felt the sound as much as hearing it.\r\n\r\nIf only someone or a studio with the right budget, could reinvent a naval war film with such intense moments that could give you PTSD.\r\n\r\n>But he was quite hard of hearing. I asked him why and he told me part of his “job” in the war was when they would land on an island he and two other guys would strap a communication wire to their backs and run/crawl as far inland as they could to call in coordinates for the shelling from the big guns. He said the smaller 5″ shells weren’t bad but from the 16’s it didn’t matter how deep you had yourself buried in the dirt with your hands clamped over your ears as tight as you could; with the shells hundreds, even thousands of feet overhead, when they went over it was like you were laying on train tracks with a freight train going over you just inches away from your head. You could feel the air being sucked out of your lungs, the ground would shake and the roar just from the shell going over penetrated so deep in your head it hurt.\r\n\r\nThese ships at the time along with some battlecruisers, have all the firepower to deliver that intense shock and awe effect. Massive guns and all the science behind it. Loud. Boom. Terrifying.\r\n\r\n>It\'s way more than 10x louder than a tank gun. When the entire battery of 16 inch guns are fired it literally rocks the battleship (a battleship!!! 50,000+ tons) 10-20 degrees and moves the entire ship back in the water.\r\n\r\n>he said that once he found and read interviews with survivors published in a magazine which he had found in his university’s library (meaning it is not strong evidence and I can’t promise their honesty) stating that Yamato had it’s AAA in the center and even with the main guns aiming at sides the AAA crew would be safe from the blast cone. however it would affect them largely. he remembered that it was stated that many AAA crew wouldn’t respond to new orders or calls simply because they got (permanently or temporarily) deaf from the 9 18″ guns barraging into the air. another one stating that when he was carrying 25mm ammo boxes to the guns while he was climbing down a flight of stairs with 1 heavy ammo box in each hand, all 3 guns of the second forward turret fired and the blast wave shook him off sent him falling off painfully on a ledge and then into the sea, which he thought that was why he survived. another one stating while he was attending the wounded inside the ship each main gun fire felt like they were inside a gigantic church bell and the bell would ring super loud.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, not good-but QUALITY movies out there, where the film makers wanted to and actually delivered heart pounding, adrenaline-induced scenes in their movies. Excessive Michael Bay explosions and scenes that change every 2 seconds is the opposite of this. Most always the underrated movie is the better quality film than your average overrated junkpiece blockbuster.\r\nTransformers had some pretty cool CGI and I\'ll give it that, however I cannot bring myself to ever continue watching another one after falling asleep to the 2nd in a theater.\r\n\r\nWe need a real rocker of a Naval war film (I\'d sure as Hell would love one). I want to experience the thunder and intensity of the cannons, the Japanese and American warplanes roaring overhead, the true horror sailors/fleet officers would experience when enemy shells ripped through a vessel\'s hull. The loudness, and the heavy fire from enemy guns or aircraft. The pounding or shelling of islands ashore.\r\n\r\nI am just calling for a decent warfilm that will stand on its own as an incredibly well done movie, not needing 5 sequels to go with it to rake in profit from the zombies of our time. Saving Private Ryan has done this. I\'m looking for something that will take bits and pieces from each of these films: Master and Commander, (the life on board the ship and hardly going beyond that) Das Boot and U-571 (the depth charges exploding overhead, and the crew members sit there quietly waiting, anticipating, trembling), and Pearl Harbour (There were some parts of this movie I did not like, but the overwhelming aerial bombardment of Oahu felt devastating).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeen wanting to speak my mind about this for some time. There were a fuckton of conflicts in the Pacific. This leaves room for more entertaining but tragic war films, one of my favorite genres.

It was very well received by the critics and public. The music, animation and the story was great. It also had a successful Broadway show. Belle was considered the 1st independent Disney princess then. I was a toddler  when it came out so I was obviously too young to remember the hype lol. I did see the film on VHS and sing along to the songs with my siblings.\r\n\r\nLion King was the highest grossing Disney film (before and after the re-release and then before Frozen and Zootopia). It was very well-received by the critics and It won 2 Oscars for the music and won the Golden Globe for the film on general. The music, story, and animation was also excellent. The voice acting especially for Mufasa and Scar was amazing. The Broadway show is one of the top grossing and longest running shows in Broadway history.  I think the impact was much bigger than BatB. Just look at all the sequels, parodies, and of course the Broadway show. This was the most successful non-princess Disney film at the time. I was 4/5 when it came out and I remembered the hype very well. I had the backpack lol\r\n\r\nBoth films are still beloved classics.','The Lion King',5,23,'2017-03-17 04:18:08'),('601tz3','Disney’s Live-Action Mulan Has a ‘Touch of Ridley Scott’','','Dumbo',31,18,'2017-03-17 22:04:44'),('602n7l','One of the few times that an actor has made chills tingle down my spine.

(Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Godzilla vs. Kong)','I assume many of you also grew up watching the Japanese Godzilla films. Godzilla was a big part of my childhood so being able to see him on the big screen in photorealistic CGI and fighting other monsters is a dream come true.\r\n\r\nTwo more Godzilla films have been announced for 2019 and 2020. Legendary confirmed that they have acquired the rights to Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah from Toho so what do you want to see? Even if it\'s just something small. A detail, a scene, a shot, an easteregg. What do you want from these movies?\r\n\r\nWhat I want is more sci-fi. Remember those tanks in the old movies that fired blue energy beams? Something like that. I\'d love it if they embraced the slightly cornier side of Godzilla with awesome sci-fi weapons. Would make sense for the goverment to fund research in that field after Godzilla 2014. I also would have loved it if they acquired the rights to Biollante. They could have included a huge carnivorous plant in Kong: Skull Island that looks a lot like Biollante. It could have attacked the soldiers with its vines and maybe swallowed one or two. After taking it down with a flamethrower we could have had a scene where we see them taking samples and seeds of it. There\'s your backstory for Biollante!\r\n\r\nAnother scene I see in my head is this:\r\nIt\'s nighttime and raining, the full moon behind the clouds softly illuminating the scene. But there is more light. Several rows of huge military floodlights illuminate a vast rural landscape with hills and some woods here and there. In the distance a giant monster is approaching and we see the military rolling its energy weapons tanks and missile launchers to the front. In the command tent officers are gathered around a table with a plan on it. We learn that once the monster crosses a certain line they will open fire. Slowly the monster comes closer, everybody is tense. They feel every mighty step the creature takes. The clouds clear up a bit, revealing the full moon which reveals the monster in all its glory. The order comes, open fire! We see barrage after barrage of missile fire, bright orange fires erupt on the monsters skin in sharp contrast to the blueish hue of the rainy night. They start firing their energy weapons. While the first impacts of the shells and missiles shook the monster a bit and slowed it down a bit, it didn\'t really seem to care. The energy weapons have no pushback on the monster but where they hit we see its skin badly burned and charred open. It\'s effective! The monster screams in agony... or rage? It charges the military who keep firing everything they\'ve got but the monster comes closer and closer, nothing seems to be able to slow it down. It crashes into the war machinery trampling all over and everything gets destroyed. The hope after seeing the energy hits has been dashed into pieces and soldiers flee in fear and panic.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough from me.

The Good Dinosaur is about a boy and his dog, lost in the Old American West... but with dinosaurs!\r\n\r\nThat is a really cool story, and they meet some very interesting characters, and have some fun adventures.

But that wasn\'t as distracting as the conflicting cartoony-ness of the characters and harsh realism of life in that time. Making a dinosaurs till land and plant crops looks silly; and the animation style of the characters fits that with its smooth cartoon veneer. But then we have to watch these childish renderings go on a hard coming-of-age journey. It was really jarring.\r\n\r\nIt\'s the first Pixar film I\'ve seen that I think would\'ve been better as a straight forward story without a gimmick.

I had saw it before at an advanced screening, and didn\'t anticipate seeing it again. At least, in theaters.\r\n\r\nLet me just say now, it started off as a joke. I was joking about just how much money this movie was shamefully gonna make, and kidded about seeing it again. But as it turns out, my friend wasn\'t kidding. He actually wanted to go see the piece of shit.\r\n\r\nI was hesitated, but sure, why the fuck not?\r\n\r\nAs for actual criticism, I did catch one thing, and that was the 3D effects in this movie are actually pretty great. If you love seeing depth and things fly out at you in 3D, The Boss Baby is a treat for that. I didn\'t catch these things upon my first viewing, as I saw the film in 2D. So if you somehow find yourself watching this movie, do yourself a favor and maybe you\'ll enjoy seeing the 3D. Maybe also get shitfaced to shit so you can actually enjoy this movie. Lots of movie theaters serve alcohol nowadays anyway.\r\n\r\nSo that\'s it for actual criticism, and for the rest of this review, I would like to encourage a fan theory. I would have mentioned all of this in my first viewing, but I\'d figured it\'d be stretching it, considering how absurd it sounds. But having sat through this shit again, I can\'t help but mention it. If you wanna call bullshit out on me, go right a fucking head. I don\'t even think you\'ll see this movie you little shit. Let alone fucking two times in a week.\r\n\r\nThe Boss Baby, as dumb as it may appear on the surface, is a massive metaphor for childhood loneliness and depression.\r\n\r\nLet that sentence sink in. Now I know what you\'re thinking: how the fuck did you get to that conclusion? Well, as Anakin would put it, \'This is where the fun begins.\'.\r\n\r\nSo the first five minutes of this movie is Tim and his imagination, playing outside and having fun on many misadventures. Though as the narrator (somehow played by Tobey Maguire... c\'mon Tobey, you can do better...) puts it, many things happened in his childhood, and despite the wackiness of it all, it was just the way he remembered it. Remember that for later. These misadventures include searching the congo, being eaten by a shark but miraculously making it out alive, going on a crashing space ship, you get the idea. The movie makes a great point of making this all seem like Tim\'s imagination. Another thing is that all of this also involve his parents playing with him, which the movie makes obvious.\r\n\r\nNow comes a scene where it is bedtime, and his parents ask Tim for a new baby brother, to which Tim rudely declines, and often wishes it would be the three of them forever.\r\n\r\nSo it comes as a surprise that Tim\'s little baby brother, who shows up in a taxi and a suit appears, despite his opinion on the subject. Did his parents really not give a shit about the whole thing? Obviously, this can\'t really be happening.\r\n\r\nThe thing about The Boss Baby is that it never knows when it goes too far. Obviously, this is a kids\' movie, right? So I should be more then able to determine what is grounded and what\'s not, right? But the movie makes this difficult to see, because as Tim said it, he remembers things differently than how they actually happened.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that certain things never happened in The Boss Baby, as the movie would like to make you think. Particularly, I don\'t think the actual Boss Baby actually existed throughout the whole film, and rather, is Tim\'s escape to find an actual friend after being cooped up by his parents for so long.\r\n\r\nThe movie also suggests Tim isn\'t exactly the guy to hang out with at school. As The Boss Baby says, Tim\'s grades consisted of C\'s throughout the board, Tim still hangs out with a stuffed animal despite his age, and Tim can\'t ride his bike without training wheels. This all suggests Tim was really a disappointing figure in his family, despite his parents\' supposed love for him, it\'s obvious that they want a new kid who wouldn\'t begin in life in such a weak manner.\r\n\r\nBut I\'m getting off track. So yes, The Boss Baby only exists so Tim can actually have some sort of friend to play with, despite The Boss Baby being an imaginary figure.\r\n\r\nNow as the movie clearly demonstrates, The Boss Baby and Tim don\'t exactly get along. But still, his parents are busy with this supposed baby, and aren\'t around for Tim nearly as much. These scenes are difficult, as we can\'t exactly know what is true and what isn\'t. In an attempt to defend my point, I\'d say most scenes with the parents and the Baby are made up. Though I do believe the scene where his parents are so tired (for all sake and purposes, we\'ll say they\'re tired for work, since the upcoming convention has proved to be a stressful deal for them) is indeed, non-fiction. This helps the idea that Tim really was alone, no longer receiving bedtime love, stories, or songs. Tim easily goes in the day alone, but at night is the time where he needs his parents the most, but as shown, they aren\'t there for him.\r\n\r\nI\'m probably skimping over a few details here and there in this review, so I apologize in advance. Leave a comment should you have a question about this theory.\r\n\r\nAnywho, there\'s a scene in which the guest babies are in Tim\'s parents house. The obvious reason for this is that Tim\'s parents are considering the new baby, and thus, bring along some co-workers to discuss the matter in the kitchen. Thinking the Boss Baby is real, Tim spies on the babies. But in a conflict with the Boss Baby, Tim must defend a tape from the babies.\r\n\r\nNow this causes a scene that\'s pretty crazy. There\'s an explosion, a broken fence, weapons, and all kinds of stuff all in Tim\'s backyard. The more comical elements of the situation are fake. But what is real is the, for lack of a better word, abuse, of the babies. As said earlier, Tim is just a lonely boy who wants a friend, and the fact that he has some in his own living room really makes for something existing for Tim. However, as this is the first time he has played with anybody but his parents, let alone a small child, causes some slightly violent situations. Tim is reckless throughout the scene, and the babies end up crying for his mad behavior. This also causes Tim to be grounded by his parents, to which Tim pleads that the baby can talk. But his parents have none of that shit in mind.\r\n\r\nSo more things happen, as the pet convention comes up rapidly. Now here is where things get a little murky for my liking, but I\'ll do my best to defend my points.\r\n\r\nAs the movie leads you to believe, the parents are impressed by Tim\'s new fonded chemistry with the Boss Baby, and thus, bring him along to bring your kid to work day. Using my own set of skills, I have reason to believe the work day existed, but only certain elements of it. Once again, the parents say they can bring the baby along, but this is a fragment of Tim\'s head.\r\n\r\nThey head to the actual work day, as his parents apologize for not being around to play with Tim often, so they ask Tim if he wants some exclusive time to play around. However, Tim declines, in favor of going around the convention alone (well, with the baby). So his parents let him do so.\r\n\r\nA lot of what happens in this scene is fairly fake, as Tim and the Baby go through trap doors, security guards, and other shenanigans. I would detail every single thing, but unfortunately, I don\'t have the exact movie memorized, so I do apologize. Maybe I\'ll revisit all of this when the movie comes out on Blu-Ray.\r\n\r\nAnd who, the final conclusion is that instead of leaving behind one of the parents, both parents go to Vegas instead, leaving behind Tim with a babysitter. As Tim says, he has been with many babysitters before, so it\'s not like this has been the first time his parents have left him alone. Though it\'s easy to assume this is the first time his parents were expected to be away for so long, given that Tim is anxious about the entire situation.\r\n\r\nSo, the babysitter is put into a trap by Tim (and the Boss Baby would lead you to believe) and he runs off to go to the airport in an attempt to save his parents. More shenanigans ensue, mostly fake, as he is left alone in an airport with the Boss Baby. The thing is, is that Tim blames most of this on The Boss Baby, and so, The Boss Baby gets sick of his attitude to the point where he leaves Tim alone in the airport. Tim weaps alone in the airport, to himself singing Black Bird by the Beatles. As I failed to mention, the song was played previously by his parents before he went to sleep. By singing the song to himself is a symbolic reference to his attempt to find happiness. As well as to remind him of his only true friend, his parents. This scene is indeed real, even if the means of him getting to the airport was rather comical.\r\n\r\nThis scene also helps makes obvious the fact that The Boss Baby indeed doesn\'t exist. Surely, a baby going around an airport alone in a suit would clearly drive some attention, potentially to the point of calling CPS in an attempt to find the baby. But obviously, The Boss Baby comes back later to \'save\' Tim and find his parents by going aboard a plane without tickets. From this scene all the way to the beginning of the end, is all mostly fake, as they aboard first class without parents or tickets, get in a limo without cash, aboard a pirate ship (obviously, this was a less grounded scene in the film), almost fall into a boiling pool of... a liquid. It\'s supposed to be the eternal baby shit, but you know, and also, save his parents by allowing a puppy factory to go hay wire.\r\n\r\nTo make things easier, we can presume the baby sitter caught up to the airport, found Tim, and brought him home. The movie also never presents the means of how his parents, Tim, and the baby go home. Instead, they cut to the house like nothing happened, more or less.\r\n\r\nThe Boss Baby finally leaves Tim, as his parents forget the whole situation never happened. A clear red flag that none of it happened. Plus, even if it did, you\'d figured, somebody else would know about it, such as the co-workers, or even the babies of the co-workers. I suppose the baby workers could also erase the minds of them, but presuming the baby did actually go to Vegas and work, how many minds would have to be erased at that point? Not to mention, perfectly finding times for those people to be a sleep to wipe their memories. It just seems excessive to me.\r\n\r\nTim is now alone again, as he writes a letter to the Boss Baby to bring him back. Another red flag here. The address is only labeled as BabyCorp, and so for a regular mailman who probably grew up as any other human being, he would have no fucking clue where to send it. The only way could possibly be if somehow objects also transcended with people into the baby world. Remember, the way to teleport to the baby world is by sucking a pacifier rapidly. And I just can\'t see how other objects get in, without the object also becoming one with the baby world. Maybe I\'m just fucking crazy and thinking about this way too hard. Honestly, if you\'re somehow still reading this, hats off to you, but go find a life man. You\'ll find some enjoyment anywhere but here.\r\n\r\nAnywho, one way or another, a new baby is in Tim\'s house, one who looks just like The Boss Baby. Tim is excited to have the \'Boss Baby\' back, even in actual human form. But here\'s the dark part for me, that I feel would go over most of the audience member\'s head.\r\n\r\nObviously, this new baby, despite looking like The Boss Baby, isn\'t actually the Boss Baby. He can\'t talk, he can\'t walk, nada. So Tim, whether he realizes it or not, actually has to rebuild his entire relationship with this new baby, as the baby\'s memory was completely wiped of Tim, presumably at least. And even if the baby still remembered Tim, there would be no way to communicate that, considering he\'s an actual baby now, one or must learn to walk, talk and write all over again. So while Tim has succeeded in getting a new friend, or family member at least, it caused the removal of one of his previous friends at that cost.\r\n\r\nIF YOU DON\'T WANNA READ THIS SHIT JUST READ THIS M8:\r\n\r\nI have no fucking clue if I\'m making sense or not. I hope to god I am. Maybe someone else had this wacky ass fucking theory. But man, with these concepts in your head, really fuck up your viewing of this movie, with plot holes or not. I almost cried at the end of this movie upon my first screening for some of the reasons here. That\'s something Inside Out couldn\'t even do. Okay, I\'m lying, I almost cried in that one too, but still. All I can say at this point is, until I can debunk my own theory (which would require another viewing of the movie, which I sure as hell ain\'t doing anytime soon), I\'m gonna spread these ideas like wildfire, or at least try to. I have no fucking clue if this will get any attention or not. If it does, good, if not, I shall keep these ideas to myself. So grab a beer, or smoke a bowl, whatever your choosing, buy a 3D ticket, and see for yourself what the fuck is actually going on in this movie.\r\n\r\nAlso, like I said, if you somehow sat through this whole review, I don\'t know what to say to you. Thanks, I guess?','The Kitchen',2,2,'2017-04-01 01:14:06'),('633at5','The CGI in the \'War for the Planet of the Apes\' Trailer is almost unbelievably good. What could this mean for other movies?','I was really blown away by the apes in the new War for the Planet of the Apes [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDcAlo8i2y8). \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI had seen both previous films and thought the apes already looked remarkably good. In the [first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDbwEQG2cqI) they were past the uncanny valley but still easily identifiable as CGI and even though they were believable enough, you subconsciously felt like they were a bit off. \r\nThe [second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpSaTrW4leg) I found visually even more impressive (It looked stunning overall), many of the scenes made the apes look so realistic (and thanks to the amazing work of Andy Serkins and co. very natural in their voice, facial expressions and movement) that you sometimes forgot that these characters were animated and not even human. They were 99% there.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSeeing the trailer for the new film you could say they only look slightly better, slightly more detailed, their skin and hair slightly more realistic, their eyes slightly more alive. And you would be right. But I feel like those last 0,5-1% make such a huge difference. I mean look at their eyes when they\'re talking, the way their faces shine in the dark when they are dimly lit. It simply looks like a real ape, filmed through a movie camera. You can completely forget that these are not real, they feel so human, so natural. And not in an uncanny way. Maybe it\'s just me but I would gladly watch a movie like this without any humans in it. The apes work so well as characters. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOf course there is always room for improvement but it\'s at a point now where I not only find them convincing, but where my subconsciousness accepts them as real. And that\'s huge because I\'m usually one who gets easily thrown off by some wacky CGI(-physics). With buildings, metal things (iron man\'s suit) etc. the technology has been there for I\'d say about 5 years now. Of course often times stuff still looks not quite good enough but I\'ve seen things I could have sworn were real which I later found out were in fact CGI too many times by now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo I guess three questions:\r\n\r\nFirst: Am I the only one who thinks it looks almost too fucking good?\r\n\r\nSecond: Can anybody with some knowledge in this area point out some specific things they did improve on throughout the series, what is it that makes them look even more believable in this one? Were there any technology breakthroughs recently?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly: What does this mean for other movies? A \'Planet of the Apes\' movie with only apes in them would be perfectly fine now I guess. And then there are things like the Avatar Sequels or really any other movie with non-human CGI-Characters, do you think they too will make some sort of leap in the next few years or is it too specific to the fact that apes are very human-like after all?\r\n\r\n','Breakthrough',58,50,'2017-04-02 20:13:24'),('63irec','The Wrong Guy (1997) - What\'s r/movie\'s opinion on this low budget comedy gem?','This was a little known and low budget comedy gem when I was growing up.

Handel\'s piece in particular provides an adept soundtrack to Barry\'s wanderings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that it\'s one of the most beautiful films ever made, but what struck me more is that some of it is downright hilarious, with Leonard Rossiter\'s early [cameo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCwzsFEJyw), and the highwaymen providing some of the best examples of the film\'s dry (and almost accidental) comedic prowess. \r\n\r\n\r\nThese characters do not know they are being funny, just as they cannot help but be dragged along by the forces of fate. Ryan O\'Neal\'s detached performance as the detached titular character works perfectly for me.

Obviously this is a win for a very weak weekend that is more a holding pattern before The Fate of the Furious takes more screens than any other film in April history. Still the film featured a very solid 47% drop and of course is profiting off a very surprising $50M opening last weekend, far surpassing expectations. Not to mention Boss Baby completely shrugged off the animated film competition in Smurfs. Right now the film is performing about the same level as Dreamwork\'s 2015 film Home, and should similarly end up in the $175M range domestically. Boss Baby isn\'t going to be remembered as a groundbreaking animation but it has shown that there is a market still for the more cartoony, silly animated films especially in an always hungry marketplace. \r\n\r\n* The Smurfs are a weird brand. Why does the **Smurfs: The Lost Village** an animated Smurfs movie open at #3 to $14M when a live/action movie about Smurfs in New York trying to save some dudes marriage open at #2 to $35.2M? Who knows, but yes the newest animated Smurfs film failed to excite even the children as it barely maid any money in its US opening, opening even worse than the previous live action films mentioned. The strange thing is Sony already knew that Smurfs: The Lost Village would fizzle in the US as the film was barely intended for a US audience in the first place. See the Smurfs are really popular overseas, like the last two movies made over $250M in international sales popular. And now the film is basically pulling a xXx: Return of Xander Cage move, giving a wide release in the US but barely caring about it and focusing all the efforts on the foreign markets. So far it seems to be working as the film made $42M overseas already. It also helps Sony is pulling an Illumination move of keeping the cost down (Lost Village only costs $60M) which gives a lot of buffer if the film fails to ignite overseas. Sony isn\'t the only one trying to profit off surprisingly brand loyalty overseas. Did you know Universal has an animated Woody Woodpecker movie coming out this year? If you didn\'t it\'s probably because you don\'t live in Brazil. Yup, Brazil is the only country currently with a planned release for the film, they already have Brazilian trailers and posters for the movie. See the thing is, Woody Woodpecker is insanely popular in Brazil, with many kids growing up on him in that country. So instead of doing what Sony did Universal just cut out the middleman and are making a major character in their library just for a non-English language country. There\'s a very interesting world these two films are possibly opening up, where these troublesome properties with nowhere to go but are surprisingly popular outside the usual English language countries could become pinpoint targeted with to those markets.\r\n\r\n* Guess the old guys doing stuff genre still has some juice in it as **Going in Style** opened to a surprising #4 with $12.5M. While that sounds pretty bad, and it\'s certainly not amazing, it actually surpassed the studio and prediction houses\' expectations which didn\'t even have it cracking the teens. The film seems to be on track with similarly themed Last Vegas, which also featured famous older actors doing wacky young people things which cost about $28M (this film cost $25M) and opened in the teens. If we are looking at that film\'s progress then Going in Style should have solid legs and end up making about $50M - $60M when all is said and done. At the very least this is the highest opening for director Zach Braff of his career by 25x, though his last two films were indie releases so that may not really count. \r\n\r\n* Time for the small release round-up! After a string of losses it seems Pure Flix has found a new minor hit with **The Case for Christ**, a biopic about a famous atheist turned Christian defender that opened on 1,100 screens to #10 spot with $3.9M. This comes after the disasterous performance of the much maligned I\'m Not Ashamed, showing Pure Flix should stick to their brand, claiming atheists are dummies. This week also finally saw the release of megahit anime film **Your Name** which opened in 300 theaters to $1.6M. That represents a solid per theater average of $5,281 so it will be interesting to see if Funimation tries to expand more to see if the film will be a surprise hit like it was in Japan and China. However winner of per theater average this week was **Colossal** the odd Anne Hathaway film which is a mix of mumblecore and kaiju film which has gotten mixed reviews but seems to be on track for a possible big expansion in the coming weeks as it opened in just 4 theaters to $125,809, a per theater average of $31,452. This will be an interesting film to watch as it is the first release from NEON, the new distribution company from Alamo Drafthouse which is hoping to be a more mainstream, A24-esque distribution arm compared to Drafthouse Films which is typically more niche and small scale. \r\n \r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

However the film demolished the overseas opening weekend record by more than $100M, opening to $432.3M. It has also dethroned The Force Awakens as the #1 worldwide opening weekend, $532M.','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | The Fate of the Furious | $100,181,640 |  $532,481,640 | 1 |\r\n| 2 | The Boss Baby | $15,540,000 | $238,881,247  | 3 |\r\n| 3 | Beauty and the Beast (2017) | $13,634,000 | $1,043,049,751 | 5 |\r\n| 4 | Smurfs: The Lost Village | $6,500,000 | $95,028,326 | 2 |\r\n| 5 | Going in Style  | $6,350,000 | $35,076,352 | 2 |\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* I guess in a way everyone was right about their predictions for **The Fate of the Furious**. Those predicting that the meteoric jump in sales from Fast & Furious 6 to Furious 7 (I love these titles) was a momentary blip due to the death of Paul Walker and that 8 would settle down to a more reasonable level were correct on the domestic side where FotF opened $47M lower than F7, opening at #1 with $100M. However the other side that predicted F7 was just the latest peak of a still growing franchise nailed it in terms of international sales. See while FotF\'s domestic opening isn\'t even in the top 40 of all time (it\'s not even the best opening of 2017), it now colds the record for #1 highest overseas opening of all time by a whole lot. The film made $432.3M overseas this weekend, which is a $115.6M lead over the previous winner, Jurassic World which made $314M in its overseas opening. In fact that amount is so good the film has now also taken the record for all time worldwide opening from The Force Awakens ($529M), earning a cumulative total of $532M. Again the domestic opening was $47M lower than F7 and $150M lower the TFA\'s domestic opening weekend. This weekend really shows you how powerful the international appeal of the franchise has become. On the Bill Simons podcast, producer of the franchise Neil Moritz says that almost every TV in the world will have a Fast and Furious film on there somewhere and I believe it. We are seeing Universal pay off from 7 films just existing in cultural spaces around the world for 15 years and now a whole generation of people around the world have grown up with these films, particularly those under the age of 25. In fact the film debuted to #1 in every single one of the 60 territories it premiered in. It also helps that it seems Vin Diesel has become China\'s biggest star as he once again opens a film huge in China, this time the biggest opening for any film in the country\'s history, $190M. It\'s clear the weird, crazy road it took to get the franchise to this point is paying off in full. What\'s unclear is how long this will last but I think it\'s safe to say the last ride for the franchise is a very long way away. \r\n\r\n* While Fate of the Furious rockets towards becoming the next film of 2017 to break $1B, the first film of the year to do so is now officially **Beauty and the Beast (2017)** which broke $1B worldwide this week. The film managed to drop fairly slight the last 4 weeks, and is the 4th fastest film to reach $300M domestically. This also means it\'s surpassed The Jungle Book to be the highest grossing live action remake of a Disney animated film. Once again the split for the film favors mostly domestic, much like the recent $1B Disney films Rogue One and Finding Dory.  \r\n\r\n* Just a quick little fun find I wanted to share from the weekend numbers. Ever heard of the movie **Spark: A Space Tail**? It\'s an animated film about a monkey in space. No not that one, this is a different one. Well you probably haven\'t head of the film as it opened to #24 to $112K. So sound like a limited release except this movie was released in 365 theaters, which means it has a per theater average of just $308. To compare, A Dog\'s Purpose is in its 12th week and it has a per theater average of $586. And of course the film is distributed by Open Road Films, making Spark the 6th bomb in a row for the company. \r\n\r\n \r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

All we get to see are those now pretty annoying super hero flicks, bad animation movies or some mildly interesting dramas and bio pics.\r\n\r\nI was thinking back to, in my opinion great (and some also not *that* great) science fiction movies like (in no particular order and definitely not a complete listing)  \r\n*Her*, *Ender\'s Game*, *Snowpiercer*, *Inception*, *Interstellar*, *Edge of Tomorrow*, *The Zero Theorem*, *Mr. Nobody*, *Transcendence*, *The Giver*, *Lucy*, *Elysium*, *Primer*, *Oblivion*, *A Scanner Darkly*, *Predestination*, *Automata*, *Ex Machina*, ...  \r\nand of course classics like *Alien 1,2,3*, *Star Wars*, *Star Trek* and so on; you get the idea, I hope.\r\n\r\nMovies like those are so rare nowadays, every time I look at the schedule of my favorite theaters I get disappointed, because nothing like this is showing.\r\n\r\nWhere are all those stories of the future, in which the writer(s) explore an interesting idea of what could be and how it could be abused or how society could look like under the given premises??\r\n\r\nI recently watched *Black Mirror* on Netflix and it reminded me of this genre and that I miss it being celebrated on the big screen dearly.\r\n\r\n**Do you guys feel the same?

Supposedly Damon Lindelof\'s revisions turned the original Jon Spaihts script from a \'straightforward\' *Alien* prequel into the finished product. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I found that some other criticisms of the movie can actually be rationalised somewhat. Some of these flaws are referred to as \'plot holes\', but they\'re not; characters making odd decisions doesn\'t make plot holes.\r\n\r\n**They shouldn\'t have taken their helmets off!**\r\n\r\nAgreed. I think this was meant to show that Holloway was something of a maverick who lets his curiosity get the better of him. It also makes him berating Shaw, Noomi Rapace\'s character, somewhat hypocritical when claiming that her pursuit of the alien head during the silica storm (which looked cool, by the way) could have compromised the expedition.\r\n\r\n**The geologist with the mapping probes got lost!**\r\n\r\nFifield was a geologist, not a mapping specialist. He deployed the \'pups\' to map the caves, but they were streaming mapping data to the *Prometheus,* not back to the explorers. He and the rest of the team could only follow in the directions they travelled and didn\'t have maps of the structure, which was how they got lost. Later on, he and Millburn, the biologist, were able to give a grid reference for their position, but that was much later.\r\n\r\n**The biologist is scared of corpses!**\r\n\r\nThat was Fifield. He was the one who got creeped out by the giant Engineer corpse, although Millburn also got cold feet.\r\n\r\n**The biologist shouldn\'t have touched the alien worm!**\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Millburn was an evolutionary biologist with an interest in phylogenetics, the study of evolutionary relationships between organisms, and his experience in the field - and therefore live animals - was therefore limited. The deleted scenes which showed him picking up a small live alien worm and picking up dead alien skin would have helped explain his curiosity towards the hammerpede and why he stretched out his hand towards it. He actually did the right thing by not making sudden, quick movements that could startle an animal - not that it helped in the end.\r\n\r\n**Vickers should have run to the side!**\r\n\r\nPeople like to point this one out as an example of \'stupidity\', but it needs to be pointed out that both her and Shaw were running in the same direction, with Shaw moving in a different direction after tripping. Not only were both characters panicked and not thinking straight, *they couldn\'t see which direction the crashing Juggernaut was falling,* so they couldn\'t know to get out of the way. The audience has the benefit of a wide angle that shows the ship falling; they didn\'t.\r\n\r\nSupposedly Ridley Scott explained in an interview that the crew weren\'t \'the best of the best\'; they were the best *who were willing to go.* If there was some way of explaining or expressing that concept within the movie itself, that would have definitely helped. \r\n\r\nOverall, I found *Prometheus* interesting to watch, and while it\'s by no means perfect, it\'s possible to explain at least *some* of its flaws.

My list:\r\n\r\nFifth - **Hot Fuzz.** This is one of the funniest films ever, and it\'s also incredibly clever. I love all the movies in the Cornetto Trilogy, but I think this is the funniest, and had a genuinely interesting plot. The 3rd act, wow! I think the writing is on point, the visual comedy is sublime, and there are some genuinely great performances from the likes of Nick Frost and Timothy Dalton, as well as some pretty awesome cameos. Definitely my favourite comedy of all time. \r\n\r\nFourth - **Casino Royale.** I\'ve been a fan of the James Bond movies for as long as I can remember, and this is definitely my favourite. The action is some of the best, and I love the turn to gritty-realism that was a polar opposite of it\'s predecessor *Die Another Day*. It was a complete reboot, with Daniel Craig my favourite Bond, and Martin Campbell one of the most competent directors to grace the series. The acting from Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre is amazing, and the action throughout is really well shot, something that is hard to find in action movies these days. Even with a 2.5hr runtime and some quite lengthy poker scenes, I\'m hooked throughout the entire movie, and the twist at the end still never fails to shock me.\r\n\r\nThird - **Road to Perdition**. This is an amazing crime thriller, that I really didn\'t expect to enjoy as much as I did. The trailer is pretty bland, but I was blown away by one of Tom Hanks\' best performances of all time, Sam Mendes\' best film, incredibly writing, beautiful cinematography and a wonderous score. The film never missteps, with an thrilling and exciting film throughout. Jude Law, Daniel Craig and Paul Newman are also brilliant in their roles and I really love the scene in the rain between Newman and Hanks at the end. One of the few films to have ever made me cry, properly emotional ending and pretty great throughout. I definitely recommend this film to pretty much anyone!!\r\n\r\nSecond - **Prisoners.** I watched this film very recently, and it was the most thrilling, disturbing and distressing film I\'ve ever scene. Borderline unwatchable at times, the effect on me was the only film to ever have me speechless. Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman knock it out the park with their performances, and Johann Johannsonn\'s score *cannot* go unrecognised. Paired with the dark cinematography from Roger Deakins and brilliant director from Denis Villeneueve, this film has left a permanent mark on me, and certain scenes from the film, namely the car scene at the end, I doubt I will ever forget. Tough-watch, but with brilliant results.\r\n\r\nFirst - **John Wick/John Wick: Chapter Two.** I can never decide which of these I prefer, both are easily the most enjoyable film for me. The action is so perfectly shot, with the dedication from Keanu Reeves and the stunt team really making a difference from the shaky-cam techniques used in too many action films today. The simple but effective plots, original score from Tyler Bates and beautiful shots really make for a thoroughly enjoying film.

A powerful but little-seen movie from last year.','I\'m submitting this post to draw your attention to a little-seen movie from the UK named **Notes on Blindness** (2016). I\'d like to recommend it and to spread the word.\r\n\r\nThe film is a documentary/drama about the scholar John Hull who lost his sight in 1983 after a series of surgical treatments. It was just at that moment that his son was born as well. Since that moment, he kept a diary on a voice recorder to speak to himself about his experiences with blindness. He recorded his notes on blindness for many years. This film took the original sound recordings from Hull and created a biography around them. Actors fill in the roles of Hull and his family, but what you hear here are the original recordings, while the actors in the film lip-sync the lines.\r\n\r\nHe started his Notes as a personal effort to understand blindness and what it means for him personally, in order to not be defeated by it. The film is full of visual metaphor. The cinematography is full of little efforts to make us feel a little bit blind ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a beautiful film, very profound and I would like to recommend it to everyone.\r\n\r\nI\'ve written a full review here: [review](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/notes-on-blindness-2016-review/)','Little',4,5,'2017-04-27 05:07:45'),('67y7pn','Lea Thompson To Star In New Feature Adaptation Of ‘Little Women’','','Little Women',6,0,'2017-04-27 16:09:04'),('684qqr','Examination of a trope: Born Sexy Yesterday [16 minutes]','','Yesterday',430,194,'2017-04-28 15:10:50'),('68nuov','Box Office Week: The Fate of the Furious is #1 again with $19.3M and passes $1B worldwide, How to Be a Latin Lover surprises at #2 with $12M, at #3 Baahubali 2: The Conclusion has third best opening ever for a foreign film making $10.1M in only 425 theaters, and The Circle flops at #4 with $9.3M','| Rank | Title | Domestic Gross (Weekend) | Worldwide Gross (Cume) | Week # | \r\n:---|:---|:---|:---| :---\r\n| 1 | The Fate of the Furious | $19,389,780 |  $1,060,321,355 | 3 |\r\n| 2 | How to be a Latin Lover | $12,018,500 | $12,018,500 | 1 |\r\n| 3 | Baahubali 2: The Conclusion | $10,138,189 | $10,138,189 | 1 |\r\n| 4 | The Circle | $9,320,000 |  $9,320,000 | 1 |\r\n| 5 | The Boss Baby   | $9,050,000 |  $396,625,814 | 5 |\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notable Box Office Stories:** \r\n\r\n* In all things domestic **The Fate of the Furious** is performing exactly like every non-Furious 7 film in franchise. Currently the film is performing just slightly worse than Fast & Furious 6 which had already passed $200M by this point in its domestic run while FotF is still under that number. This weekend was another solid one, a 50% drop for a third weekend at #1 with $19.3M, a decent haul but really only maintained that #1 spot because of lack of serious competition (that will be next week). That is why the fact the franchise has passed $1B as of this week is so damn incredible. The film is now the 21st highest grossing film of all time worldwide yet only the 190th highest grossing film domestically. To understand just how insane that split is, take a look at the now #22 spot, Rogue One. Rogue One has a very even split of 50/50 domestic and international, earning $532M domestic and $523M international. In comparison, Fate of the Furious has made $340M less domestically than Rogue One yet still beats it in overall numbers. It seems the film is going to likely end up with less than 20% of its total gross in US sales. The film has already passed Furious 7\'s Chinese take, earning $350M so far with a lot more room to keep expanding. This is film will likely become only the 5th film ever to make over $1B in international sales alone (Furious 7 is one of those 4 existing films by the way). Quite simply with Rogue One underperforming overseas, MCU films never breaking $1B internationally (FotF is just $30M away from the lifetime international take of The Avengers), and since we are still waiting to see if the sequels will be as successful as the originals for Jurassic World and Avatar it\'s safe to say Fast & Furious is the most important international franchise around right now. Yes, it\'s more important to the international market than Star Wars, Marvel, Jurassic Park, and Avatar. Hell of a thing for a multiracial cast in a franchise that\'s now a decade and a half old. It should also be noted that this week FotF passed the domestic gross of Get Out which means once again F. Gary Gray has the highest grossing film ever for a black director (domestic and worldwide). \r\n\r\n* This week saw two very interesting surprises in smaller releases. While Baahubali 2 had a better per theater average **How to Be a Latin Lover** beat it coming in at #2 with $12M in only 1,100 theaters. That\'s pretty damn impressive considering it outgrossed a Emma Watson/Tom Hanks film that was in 2,000 more theaters than the film. This film and Baahubali 2 represent a clear growing market share in the US marketplace for specific cultural properties. As the title suggest this is a film intended for the Spanish market by the increasingly important branch of Lionsgate, Pantelion, which has produced hits like Spare Parts and Instructions Not Included. The film is clearly a bigger play than before including hiring Ken Marino to direct and Instructions Not Included star Eugenio Derbez to star and that cross-pollination of Latin stars and Hollywood direction has paid off. The film is vastly outperforming in its limited sphere and earned an impressive A on Cinemascore, so don\'t be surprised if this gets a significant expansion in the weeks to come. \r\n\r\n* While China\'s most expensive movie of all time (The Great Wall) didn\'t exactly play like a blockbuster, India\'s most expensive movie of all time **Baahubali 2: The Conclusion** managed to seriously defy the odds coming in at #3 with $10.1M despite being in only 450 theaters, which gives it a per theater average of $23,855. That means it is the 3rd highest grossing foreign language opening ever, just behind the Jet Li films Hero ($18M) and Fearless ($10.5M), and those films were released in over 1,500 theaters for their opening weekends. In fact the last time a film was released in less than 1,000 theaters and managed to crack the top 5 was in 2015 when Everest managed the feat with $7.2M in 545 theaters, but that was in more theaters and was exclusively shown in IMAX which inflated the ticket numbers immensely. Safe to say this is one of the biggest small releases ever, and the biggest foreign limited releases of all time. Hell it\'s passed the lifetime domestic gross of Baahubali: The Beginning in just one weekend, showing just how important this film is to the Indian culture in the US. Indian cinema has been growing steadily in importance here in the US but usually the films round out the bottom of the top ten at best. While Baahubali 2 and Latin Lover are in less theaters combined than The Circle, they collectively earned $13M more than The Circle. This weekend is clearly showing that specific cultural markets in the US are extremely important right now and are only growing with each year. Baahubali 2 may be a blip on the radar but something tells me this is only beginning of a growing interest in Indian cinema in the US. *Edit: /u/KnightRidrr pointed out that tickets for Baahubali 2 were sold at $25, which certainly inflated the overall numbers. Certainly still impressive that so many were willing to pay that premium price but does explain why it made so much in so few theaters.*\r\n\r\n* I think it\'s safe to say I don\'t think I\'ve seen a more unanimously loathed film in a while than **The Circle**. The film not only received a terrible 17% on RottenTomatoes it also received a horrendous D+ on Cinemascore. Still the star power of the film seemed enough to at least bring in some money, opening at #4 with $9.3M. The film starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks tried to use current technologic fears to garner interest but what little there was hostile to say the least. The opening isn\'t terrible for the film which was made for a pretty low $18M but with a Cinemascore that bad and the megahit Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on the horizon the film could easily not pass its budget. It\'s always a fascinating moment when a film with this much talent in front of and behind the screen becomes a jumbled mess. At very least it shows that the A-list days are clearly over when an actress can\'t score in the top 3 when her last film, which is still in theaters, made $1B.\r\n\r\n* While Blumhouse Tilt is still looking for it\'s big hit, it\'s still a solid little machine as **Sleight** opened at #14 to $1.6M. Sounds terrible except the film was only in 545 theaters and only cost $250K to make. As mentioned before BH Tilt is more of a VOD platform anyways, using theatrical releases to drum up interest then quickly releasing the film on VOD which this should do well enough. \r\n\r\n* Before it likely dominates the box office next week **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** has opened overseas to a very respectable $101.2M overseas, mostly lead by the UK, Australia, and Germany. The film is tracking well over the original Guardians which was a surprise hit at the time. With any opening this strong without China, Japan, or South Korea it\'s looking like Guardians could become Marvel\'s biggest non-RDJ starring franchise. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Just dumb data meant to be fun.**\r\n\r\nI love using somewhat relevant data to predict a films Rotten Tomatoes score. The data isn’t exact and only somewhat reliable, but I enjoy seeing if old trends and actors/directors averages can somewhat predict the success of a film. I don’t have flowcharts, abacuses or an around the clock crew of rogue movie predictors working furiously in a dimly lit office. I have a will to scour through Rotten Tomatoes, Google and Youtube in an effort to have a solid data that predicts unimportant things.\r\n\r\n\r\nI predicted [XXX: The Return of Xander Cage would have a 36% RT Score] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5oty00/according_to_nonsensical_evidence_vin_diesels/) and was pleasantly surprised when it received 43%. I actually wanted to add five more points to the finished product but I went against my Vin-O-Meter and ended up short. This time I’m trying to predict the RT score of Baywatch.\r\n\r\n1. I brought back my Jet Action Scene data because Baywatch features JS action. Jet ski action scenes are the worst and they average 29% on Rotten Tomatoes. \r\n\r\n2. I collected the RT scores of recent comedic television adaptations. Aside from 21 & 22 Jump Street (85, 84), television adaptations haven’t done well with the critics. The overall average is 45.6% and only 21 & 22 Jump Street, Charlie’s Angels, Starsky & Hutch and The Man From U.N.C.L.E have fresh averages. Bewitched, Get Smart, Land of the Lost, Dukes of Hazard and The A-Team (and more) were not loved by the RT critics.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Between The Fast & the Furious, G.I. Joe, Be Cool, Journey 2, Scorpion King, Get Smart, Walking Tall, Race to WitchMountain and Hercules, The Rock loves stepping into a preexisting material. Thus, I averaged out the scores and came up with 50.3% average\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Zac Efron’s recent comedic films have been up and down on RT. Neighbors 1 & 2 are fresh (73%, 62%) whereas Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (35), That Awkward Moment (23) and Bad Grandpa (11) are pretty rotten. The uneven comedies lead to a 40.8% average. It’s not good, but it could be a lot worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Seth Gordon exploded onto the scene with the brilliant documentary The King of Kong (97%). The documentary about Donkey Kong catapulted him into directing big budget comedies Four Christmases (25%), Horrible Bosses (68%), Identity Thief (19%) and now Baywatch. His four films have an average of 52.25%. You need to watch The King of Kong now!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average of these five categories is 42.32%. Normally I’d be happy to bestow that average on a film that features jet ski action scenes. However, the movie looks really funny and it features the beloved Dwayne Johnson. So, I’m going to add another 20 points to the average and boost it into fresh territory with a 62.32% average. I’m putting my reputation on the line with this score but I’m sticking to it.\r\n\r\n**Rotten Tomatoes average for Baywatch – 42%**\r\n\r\n**My Prediction for Baywatch - 62%**\r\n\r\n[Here is the post if you want to share it!] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2017/04/29/mff-special-using-unreliable-data-to-predict-the-rotten-tomatoes-score-of-baywatch/)\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the other posts I put on Reddit.\r\n\r\n[Jet Ski Action Scenes Are the Worst] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/)\r\n\r\n[A Closer Look at Movies That Feature the Words Great, Good, Best, \r\nPerfect and Fantastic] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/60ni79/movies_that_have_best_in_their_title_have_a/)\r\n\r\n[An In-Depth Look At Movies That Feature Pencils Used as Weapons] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5vecjc/movies_that_feature_pencils_used_as_weapons_have/)\r\n\r\n[Cinematic Foghat Data] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5zj6u7/movies_that_feature_foghats_slow_ride_have_an/)\r\n\r\n[The Fast & Furious & Corona] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/64tine/the_fast_and_the_furious_movies_that_feature/)','Charlie\'s Angels',353,61,'2017-05-02 16:24:54'),('69410u','Who else likes the dreaded Rom-Com?','You can admit it, you\'ve seen one you liked. Which one was it and why? Typically targeted at woman and dreaded by men these films usually follow a simple formula. Woman meets man, they don\'t like each other. Laughs are had and by the end of the movie they are completely in love and happily ever after. \r\n\r\nQuirky side characters are always a given. Girl\'s dateless best friend, guy\'s bro-seph best friend. Wacky parents and siblings, extremely nosy and way too personal co-workers, etc. They surround the main character\'s confrontational romance and provide the laughs. \r\n\r\nI\'ve seen my fair share of these films and have to admit, they are pretty tolerable for the most part.

Usually this sort of thing doesn\'t bother me, but it stood out. Tally calls March in order to lure him away with the fake hundred grand that she wants him to be the carrier for. Ostensibly this is to lure him and Healy away so that John Boy can go over and kill Amelia. But she brings up the hundred grand before March tells her that they\'ve found Amelia. Could just be a minor continuity thing and honestly things like that don\'t detract from my enjoyment of the movie, but was just curious if I\'d missed anything. Is there some other reason that she would have for sending them on a wild goose chase and then Tally just pivoted to well lets just send over John Boy when she learned they had Amelia?\r\n\r\nThe ankle gun schtick fuckin killed me and more than makes up for this minor lapse.','Call of the Wild',13,2,'2017-05-06 00:47:47'),('69kzkw','So I watched Prometheus yesterday (spoilers)','And I enjoyed it quite a bit.

January through March, August and September are the months that can either surprise me or provide a subpar movie experience I’ve come to expect. These are the months that make movie reviewing feel like actual work.\r\n\r\nThe director, James Ponsoldt, doesn’t have a resume that is impressive enough to make me comfortable with a cast of this caliber. This is actually the second film of his I’ve reviewed. The first review being “The End of the Tour” back in 2015. This review is for a film considerably different in that this is a fictional story based on the idea of an information company akin to “Google” slowly growing in power and influence. The other is about a writer and his life. It’s clear that the stories are different however they are similar in that both films are character based stories. Neither film is action oriented. Perhaps it was the size of the cast that was the stumbling block for James to get real emotions conveyed on screen in this movie. Clearly, we cannot blame the actors because they are talented. Some are established, some up and coming, but all of them are talented. So I place the flat, almost two dimensional, delivery of each character squarely on Ponsoldt’s shoulders. We as the audience should have enjoyed intense, stressful, thought provoking characters and dialogue. Instead, we are left staring at the big screen in wonder at how so much talent can act with such mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe overall movie was not well constructed either. The screenplay was adapted from a book and often much is left out in transition from page to screen. I think everyone who has read a book and then watched the movie thought to themselves, or perhaps said to a neighbor or friend, “The book is better and has so much more to the story.” This movie felt like they took only the important chapters and then shot the film. The story didn’t really flow and it felt choppy. We meet characters but then certain ones change without real explanation (Karen Gillan), or they don’t have much to do in the film but are integral to the overall plot (John Boyega). It’s very disjointed and that’s unfortunate. I’m sure the book is great. I haven’t read it but they decided to make a movie from it so something has to be in the pages that made this story worthwhile. Unfortunately, the movie doesn’t capture whatever the magic of the book is at all. In fact, the ending is so abrupt the only character to mirror the emotion of the film at any actual point is “Stenton” played by Patton Oswalt. He has one last line in the film right at the end, then walks off screen. That about sums up this film. Just one thing after another happening with no rhythm or flow.\r\n\r\nI don’t recommend people see this film on the big screen. If you wish to watch it in the comfort of your own home, go for it. I was disappointed in this film because the talent was there to make this something truly worthwhile and it didn’t deliver. It was probably my most disappointing film to watch in 2017 so far. I’m even bummed out while writing this review. I really wanted to enjoy this film and instead I was bored and let down. No bueno folks. No bueno at all.

This was Webb\'s feature film debt and man did he knock it out of the park. Great romance film with fantastic use of non linear story telling, great performances from Joseph Gorden Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, very good editing, funny humor, and a realistic look at the concepts of love and relationships. So many romance films lie to us and tell us that relationships are easy. Wrong. \r\n\r\n2. The Amazing Spider-Man (4/5). This was my first introduction to Marc Webb as I am a huge Spider-Man fan. And I thought he did a great job updated Spidey\'s origin story in a modern day context. He also got very good performances out of Andrew Garfield (Who is still my favorite Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Who had great chemistry with Garfield).\r\n\r\n3. Gifted (3.5/5). This is his most recent film that I think more people should see (Support smaller films!). Is it perfect? No, it is a little cliched, the romance B plot feels a bit underdeveloped, and the ending, while not bad, had some script issues. But overall, it\'s very well paced and shot, has great terrific performances from Chris Evens, Octavia Spencer, Jenny Slate, and the little girl, and balances humor and heart really well.\r\n\r\n4. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2.5/5). This was a movie I drank the Kool Aid on at first. The first time I saw it, I thought it was the best Spider-Man film and I defended the film a lot. But as a rewatched it and thought more about it, the more I realize that the film is very messy, tonally inconsistent, and spends too much time trying to set up a world. I still don\'t hate the film and there are things about it I like such as the performances, the chemistry between Garfield and Stone, the action and special effects, and some specific scenes. But the movie as whole feels like there were too many cooks in the kitchen. I don\'t blame Webb for the film because while he\'s credited as the film\'s director, he was really Sony\'s puppet. I could tell he had a vision for the film, but Sony got way too involved with the film.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?','The Kitchen',0,7,'2017-05-10 20:54:45'),('6ah18g','Is There Any Hope For The Detective Pikachu Movie?','I\'m not a Pokemon fan at all.

Then I started to get semi interested when I heard that Nicole Pearlman (Guardians Of The Galaxy) and Alex Hirsch (Gravity Falls) were hired to write the script. I think both of those of those guys are very talented and defiantly have very wild imaginations (Something you need in a movie like this). It also tells me that the tone of the movie will be light hearted and fun with a lot of humor for everyone. \r\n\r\nI also started to get interested when directors like Tim Miller (Deadpool) and Dean Israelite (Project Almanac, Power Rangers) were being considered as possible directors. They seemed like interesting choices. And then they announced Rob Letterman would direct the film and I lost some of my hope. I thought Goosebumps was fine and good family fun, but nothing special. And he\'s also made really crappy movies like Shark Tale and Gulliver\'s Travels (Please don\'t screw up Dungeons And Dragons please).

It was almost a \'so bad it\'s good\' Kind of thing with his ridiculous accent but mostly flat out bad \r\n\r\nThe monsters were kinda cool at first but at the same time pretty generic looking. \r\n\r\nThe fact that NOT ONLY is the queen the reason these monsters were all being made, one easy source to take out, but they would all drop dead when she dies(which makes no sense and is super convenient), that the queen IS BROUGHT TO THE FREAKIN BATTLEFIELD WHEN THEY COULD JUST LEAVE HER BEHIND, that they stop fighting to feed her in the middle of hostile territory(the most ridiculous thing in the movie- if you like that stuff/lazy writing/plot convenience then you factually have low intelligence) it was just awful and the aliens are the dumbest creatures I\'ve ever seen \r\n\r\nAlso funny how they were all like \'how will we wrap up William Dafoes arc?\' And made him die in the most random hysterical way ever. \'Ah let\'s have these guys come get him, end up tossing gunpowder around and they all accidentally blow up!\' \r\n\r\nWhat I would have done, which would\'ve been much better, is have two or three giant monsters the size of Kaiju attacking the wall, would\'ve been a lot more badass \r\n\r\nAlso that Asian actress...I\'m not sure if it was her English speaking that was bad, but she came across as one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. I did not buy her as a military commander. Compared to someone intimidating and threatening like Eva Green in 300 ROAE (whom was also playing a military commander) she was nothing, the way she spoke made me cringe every time and was just awful, awful acting. In terms of Asian actors and actresses in Hollywood, Hiroyuki Sanada and Michelle Yeoh can act her under the table. \r\n\r\nYeah, fuck this movie. So bad. I can see why Damon and Dafoe wanted to do it because the director has made some great stuff, but this was awful. \r\n\r\nThe stuff with the aliens stopping to attack in the middle of a battle, bringing their queen all the way out instead of leaving her behind, the arrow making it at the LAST SECOND to the bombs, the queen even being a thing so they can easily get rid of all the monsters at once, we as a public cannot support such lazy writing like this.

Whenever people discuss the best James Bond movies of all time the usual suspects are Casino Royale, Goldfinger, Skyfall, From Russia with Love, OHMSS, and Goldeneye (if you’re young enough to have played the N64 game).\r\nBut I want to add a serious contender that has been criminally overlooked.\r\nConversations about Brosnan’s turn as 007 tend to agree that he was 1) a fantastic Bond who was 2) stuck with bad scripts. On the first point, yes, obviously. I’m convinced Pierce was genetically engineered in a laboratory to play Bond. On the second, I agree with one major exception.\r\n\r\nTomorrow Never Dies.\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying I love Goldeneye. It’s the movie (and game) that began my love for the series and character. But, being totally honest, it’s a fairly average plot and script. And it has major pacing issues. And the 90s synth-y soundtrack is, at times, totally unbearable. The Ferrari/Aston Martin race music is the worst. The. Worst. I’d rank Goldeneye top 10. But not a real contender in the top 5 conversation.\r\n\r\nTomorrow Never Dies, on the other hand, might be the second or third best film of the franchise. Here’s my case broken-down into broad topics:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Plot.** As is often the case with the spy genre, a lot of the Bond films have weaving twists-and-turns in plot. Lots of complication and misdirection. Through-lines can be muddled and hard to find sometimes. For example, I’ve watched Quantum of Solace three or four times and I’m still not 100% sure what happened. Something about water. Ya know. Complication. You find this in a lot of Bond films. TND, on the other hand, is very clear and fun to follow. A war between Britain and China is being orchestrated by a media mogul for rating/money. You can easily write a good log-line for this movie. In fact, that’s one of my tests for a Bond film: how hard is it to write a one sentence summary? And how interesting is that summary? TND passes that test for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Realism.** While Casino Royale will always be the most grounded in reality, I think Tomorrow Never Dies is right there too. Hear me out. You know the term yellow journalism? I hate to take you back to high school history, but it essentially started during the Spanish-American war. William Randolph Hearst was trying to crush competing newspapers. And his solution was to, essentially, manufacture a war because wars sell papers. Enough papers to kill the competition. In fact, the movie even references Hearst. The villain, Elliot Carver, wants exclusive broadcast rights in China. So not only does he sell newspapers and TV time for his insider-scoops (on the war he’s creating), he also gets a monopoly on an entire country’s consumption. Look, man. We live in a world with Rupert Murdoch and Comcast. The entire premise is pretty plausible to me. Bond film or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Michelle Yeoh.** For all the pre-release hype surrounding Die Another Day\'s Halle Berry being a strong, empowered female character in the Bond universe, she’s nothing compared to Yeoh’s Wai Lin. She’s just as capable as Bond, doesn’t need his help (except for that one time she does), and is generally kickass. She’s not some damsel in distress. And, most importantly, the movie doesn’t make a big deal about it. She’s a spy. Good at her job. And that’s it. They had talked about doing a Berry/Jinx spin-off series that no one would have watched. But I’d have loved more of Lin’s adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Cinematography.** I feel like this one is completely overlooked. Robert Elswit is an Academy Award winner for his work on There Will Be Blood, nominated for Good Night, Good Luck, and he has an impressive body of work overall. And, in my opinion, this is the second prettiest Bond film after Skyfall. The man knows how to smoke a room, light it, and kiss us with a tasteful lens flare.\r\n\r\n**Pacing.** I don’t know how to discuss pacing intelligently. I suppose it’s entirely subjective. But every time I watch TND the movie flies by. If you ask me, it’s the best paced Bond film hands down. Nothing feels excessive or superfluous. And no scene overstays its welcome or fails to serve a story purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Soundtrack.** It’s classic. No fashionable frills. Doesn’t fall victim to the stylistic interpretations of the day (I’m looking at you Goldeneye and everything in the 70s). The theme by Sheryl Crow is pretty average but serviceable. Given a choice, I’d take an okay theme in exchange for the classic instrumentation of the John Barry theme every time. And the non-theme OST work by David Arnold is great.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Everything else.** There are dozens of other things I love. The humor is spot on. Decent gadget - the touchpad smart phone was cool; I find movie car chases pretty boring, but the BMW garage scene really worked for me. Random Ricky Jay as a hacker. Vincent Schiavelli 30 seconds as the torture doctor. Teri Hatcher in a garter belt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway. Those are the broad strokes on why I think TND is much, MUCH better than it’s reputation. Or lack thereof. I’m not sure what happened here. Maybe everyone was too distracted by Titanic to notice. Or maybe I’m completely off the mark. But this will always be a top 4 Bond film to me.\r\n\r\nedit: formatting.','The Tomorrow Man',120,133,'2017-05-28 19:19:09'),('6dx47r','Why does everyone say the Batman v Superman extended cut is better? It makes the movie worse.','The biggest problem with it is that most of the deleted scenes give us information we already know. We don\'t need to see Lois playing detective in an apartment building to figure out something the audience was told forty minutes prior. We already know from the beginning that Lex is behind everything, yet the extended cut plays out this frame job as if we don\'t. How is the audience supposed to be invested in a mystery which they already know the answer to?\r\n\r\nThen there\'s that deleted scene that ruins the moral ambiguity of Batman. In the theatrical cut, Batman\'s victims who are branded by him get targeted in prison and killed. But a deleted scene in the extended cut makes it clear that the prison hits are a set up by Lex Luthor to frame Batman. What\'s the point of that? To get Batman off the hook? That\'s a cop-out.\r\n\r\nOne of the praises for the extended edition is that it supposedly gives Superman\'s dislike of Batman more set up. And it\'s true he interviews some people from Gotham about him. But at the same time, they change the kitchen scene from Clark watching Batman on the news to Clark watching something else entirely on the news. Clark\'s disdain for Batman\'s methods takes a back seat in the extended cut amidst the story of him being framed, which is entirely the wrong focus for a movie called *Batman v Superman*.','The Kitchen',0,53,'2017-05-28 20:16:19'),('6dyg68','depp pirates BO competition since 2003','Highest-grossing films of 2003\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.

Mine have pretty much stayed the same for several years. Sometimes we will go all the way to ten if a new film has come out that we really loved and cannot bring ourselves to bump one of our top five. My current top five, in no particular order, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) The Sullivans (re-released as The Fighting Sullivans). My oldest brother gave my father a VHS copy of this one year for Father\'s Day. I think I was about 10 at the time and I watched it countless times and always ended up bawling by the end of the film. It got to a point where my mother banned me from watching it because I could not stop crying. Here is the IMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037323/\r\n\r\n2) Rocky. I came upon this film on my own when I was a kid (I think it might have been playing on HBO). Weirdly enough, I immediately fell in love with Stallone and the character of Rocky. It doesn\'t hurt that Sylvester himself wrote an amazing script. I also love the fact that he has mentioned the scene where Rocky and Adrian kiss for the first time is his favorite scene of all the films. \r\n\r\n3) Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Most of my favorite films come from influence from my older siblings and this is definitely one of them. I don\'t recall how old I was but I remember watching an episode of Flying Circus with my brother when he mentioned they had made a few films. He ended up renting Holy Grail and I don\'t think I stopped laughing during the whole thing. \r\n\r\n4) Steel Magnolias. This film was not always on my list but after my mom started showing signs of dementia, this was the only thing she would sit through. If I\'m being honest, I haven\'t watched it since she passed away two years ago. However, it is still on my list because I can\'t imagine never being able to watch it again. \r\n\r\n5) The Little Mermaid. While this isn\'t my favorite Disney film, it holds the distinction of being the first film I ever saw in a movie theater. My oldest brother loved movies and took me to see this when he was on leave from the Navy for his birthday. That Christmas I remember getting in the mail a huge box of gifts from him. There were some cool things that he sent but the one that sticks out was an Ariel doll.

When my dad rented it when it came out to the movie store, to 3 year old me, it was like it could\'ve been the fourth or fifth X-Men film for all I knew. As if it were a random episode of X-Men Evolution that got adapted to screen. \r\n\r\nIt gave me the sense that there are so many other possible movies that this film could be connected to. A movie about Logan as a young man, a movie about how he got his claws. A movie about how Charles and Erik met each other for the first time. A movie about how Charles formed the X-Men. Or, a movie about how Magneto escapes from his prison, Logan\'s journey when he leaves the mansion, a movie about the X-Men stopping Mystique who has posed as Senator Kelly.\r\n\r\nIt gave the sense that this universe was open and out of all the stories they *could* have told, this is the one they chose to tell even though it was one of many.\r\n\r\nI love X2, but it didn\'t do this. It seemed to close the universe. It told Logan\'s past, it told Magneto\'s escape, Mystique posing as Kelly... and all. X3 seemed to close the book on the universe. Origins retold Logan\'s past. First Class was great, but it always had the sense that this leads up to the original film. The Wolverine, besides a picture of Storm and Jean flashbacks, was cut off from the universe. As much as I love Days of Future Past, it was like a more well done X3, it just closed the book. Apocalypse had its problems.\r\n\r\nLogan did it though. Logan gave the idea again of so many stories being in this universe. A movie about what happened to the X-Men. A movie about how Logan met Caliban. A movie about how Logan realized he was sick. A movie about the Reavers hunting the remaining mutants. A movie about what\'s up in Canada. Where does Laura go? Where do the other new mutants go? Where\'s Magneto? Just so many possibilities.','The New Mutants',93,36,'2017-06-04 15:54:36'),('6fbzjd','Would a Plastic Man movie be feasible in the DCEU?','I\'m thinking of it on 2 levels: 1.) if people want it, and 2.) If it would fit in the world the DCEU is trying build.\r\n\r\nI think it\'d be a movie like Guardians or Ant-Man where people don\'t think they need it, but start to realize that yeah, they do. Plastic Man is one of those characters thats promoted as part of a team well enough, but gets little on his own.\r\n\r\nAs to whether it\'d fit or not, it\'s debatable.

I just finished watching Close Encounters Of The Third Kind for the first time in many years and I have so much to say. I’ve seen it several times and have always enjoyed it and recall it fondly. Something possessed me this weekend to put it in and for some reason, it was like a completely different movie for me. \r\n\r\nI enjoy all the films of Steven Spielberg, though I am generally more likely to throw on Jaws, and Jurassic Park, and a lot of his works from the 2000s, than many others. I’ve seen Close Encounters before and I’ve always appreciated it. I’ve loved the scenes made memorable through popular culture, (the five tones, the mashed potatoes, etc.), but really not much more than that. \r\n\r\nI love watching a movie and it suddenly becomes brand new, and for some reason this just occurred with my latest viewing of Close Encounters of The Third Kind. I knew everything that was going to happen. I remembered everything that was coming up. But for some reason, it meant so much more to me on this outing. Coming off of this viewing I’m compelled to put it near the top of my favorite Spielberg films. \r\n\r\nIf you break it down, the movie is about 15% action, and 85% reaction. We open on a series of reactions to a series of supernatural experiences. We see a literal boatload of unexplainable events take place, and the subsequent reactions. \r\n\r\nWhat I appreciated the most about it this time around, was what was capturing of reaction. I’d calculate that at least a third of the movie is just this, capturing reaction. This film has some of the greatest performances from characters who don’t even speak. We can read their faces and know everything about their current life changing experience. Thats the thing. ‘This means something. This is important’ is the sentiment that is echoed throughout the film. No one can understand or explain what is occurring, but they know its important. We see a family collapsing. We see our leads question their sanity. We see them cling to the hope that ‘this means something, this is important.\'\r\n\r\nThere’s a wonder coupled with an overwhelming eeriness with every reaction scene. \r\n\r\nWe see a father and his family falling apart over an unexplainable and impossible situation. We see his family reacting to his seeming mental deterioration. The affect it has on his wife and kids. These super rowdy semi uncontrollable kids at the beginning are reduced to silent tears amidst this chaos and confusion with their father unfolding. His transition into a psychological mess plays into their reaction as well. All three of Neary’s children as they leave him for the last time in the car with their mother don’t say a work, but we know exactly what their feeling. \r\n\r\nWe see a young child, Barry, react in delight to the arrival of these beings. He has nothing to be afraid of, as he has no concept that this is something that he should be afraid of. So he reacts clearly as a child would, with excitement and a desire to play. That makes it the most eerie for us as the viewer because we know their should be more caution exercised than what this child was doing. It freaks us out the most, because we know he should be more freaked out. Barry doesn’t say a word, but we know exactly what he is feeling. \r\n\r\nArguably, the most strange is the whistling man with his supposed family sitting in a trailer at the curve in the road. We’re led to believe they too are waiting for something they have seen before. They sit and wait with eerie anticipation for whatever is coming. A strange but mutual understanding between Neary and this family is exchanged through glances. We don’t know much about them, later scenes help us conclude that at least some of them are a little out there. But in this moment in the pitch dark middle of the night they don’t say a word, but we know exactly what they are feeling. \r\n\r\nEven more so, as the phenomenon continues, we the demographic grow and find its equally life altering for everybody. We watch young children, and even an elderly couple who are merely looking at the sky, There’s nothing to understand other than that there are lives, young and old, being changed forever in even the waiting and anticipation. Just the possibility of the arrival of these lights in the sky. These other spectators don’t say a word, but we know exactly what they are feeling. \r\n\r\nThe reactions abound throughout the movie, the scene in the helicopter particularly. We meet other people whose experience and anguish has brought them into this publicized danger zone. But they don’t care. It means something. Its important. We read the faces of these people as they try to rationalize their seeming erratic behavior. They are being told the opposite of what they are experiencing, and the battle is clear on their faces, as most of them ultimately give up. These passengers don’t say word, but we know exactly what they are feeling. \r\n\r\nFinally, the ultimate scene worth mentioning, is the actual display and communication that happens in the shadow of Devil’s Tower. Finally some official contact. We see the faces of these scholars and scientists, who have been researching and dealing with all of this for months presumably. But it doesn’t really seem to hit home for them until these moments. We watch the true wonder among all of them as the actually communicate. The eeriness as decades lost pilots return without aging a day. The keyboard player watches slack jawed as this alien race delivers tones back from his musical notes. The silence that permeates the scene is incredible, its nothing but musical tones, the occasional direction of what to play, and whats left is the sound of eerie wonder. These scientists don’t say a word, but we know exactly what they are feeling. \r\n\r\nAnd in true form of the rest of the film, when we finally see the aliens. They have no words. This can be discounted as ‘its an alien language we can’t understand’ which is fine, but i like it the most because it gives a chance for the aliens to react. They’re considerably less expressive than any of their human counterparts, but still somehow a great amount of emotion slips through. We see an excited group of smaller child like aliens take in Neary as one of their own, and no one else. It seems to make his journey all worth it. The lead alien comes out and gives an encouraging nod to everyone watching. They leave, and realistically probably not forever. These aliens don’t say a word, but we know exactly what they are feeling. \r\n\r\nLike I stated before, this movie is full of incredible performance from everyone involved. Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Bob Balaban and Teri Garr all knock it out of the dang jurassic park. But there’s equally as much to gain from the smaller and barely supporting characters that may only offer a glance toward the sky and are never seen again. I appreciate this film much more than I did a week ago, and I love when that happens with a film. I really admired Spielberg’s direction, and John Williams score, together they created a tone of eerie wonder that was present for the entire runtime. It makes the scenes with a lack of score all the more wonderful and eerie. I just have the DVD which I believe just has the special edition cut on it. My new priority is to check out the other cuts of this film, to see if they add any more to the story, and overall feel of the film. Coming off of a fresh viewing of Arrival I was itching to revisit this film, and found a lot of similarities in the tone and feeling. Though I’d say Arrival is more about feelings around the 5 tones aspect, where Close Encounters is more about the feelings experienced right after turning on the news to a mostly empty classroom. My admiration for Arrival, I’m positive is feeding into my newfound adoration for Close Encounters. I really can\'t wait to watch it again.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on Close Encounters. I’d love to discuss more about it. What are your takeaways from it? Have you realized a completely different aspect? Where does it stand with you among Spielberg\'s other achievements?\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\nClose Encounters Of The Third Kind Is A Masterpiece. Because of everything.

thinking... Hear me out, it\'s a bit weird but...\r\n\r\nWonderwoman is The Wizard of Oz.\r\n\r\nThink about it:\r\n[We have Dorothy (Wonderwoman) who after being ripped from her safe home (the amazon island) by a freak storm (the German invading army), finds out the new world (our ww1 world) she is in is in trouble because of the Wicked witch of the south (Ares). As she travels through this new world she is accompanied by 3 loyal side kicks. The tinman (pilot Steve) who throughout the story shows her the way and finds his heart back (giving something about what happens to thousands of civilians, saying he loves Wonderwoman). Then you have the lion (the sharp shooter Scotsman) which lost his courage (doesn\'t want to shoot anymore) and eventually finds it back through other means (singing for everyone). The strawman (Indian) is the third, and he is just looking for some brains (finds purpose helping people in the war, since he lost his own heritage in the American exploration). Then you have Toto, Dorothy\'s small loyal dog (the little fez guy that speaks a lot of languages, who upon meeting Wonderwoman is instantly smitten by her and doesn\'t want to leave her side).](#spoiler) \r\n\r\nThis is my theory and I stand by it.

I\'ll start off by saying that my favourite composers are as follows, in no particular order:\r\n\r\n- Hans Zimmer: This is the man who made me want to become a film composer. He\'s such a versatile composer and his work with Nolan especially always creates masterpieces. *Mombasa*, *Like A Dog Chasing Cars*, *No Time For Caution* and *You\'re So Cool* are my favourites of his, but I always look forward to his scores in the films, sometimes more than anything else.\r\n\r\n- Jóhann Jóhannsson: Possibly my favourite on this list. His score for Prisoners is truly unsettling and makes for a genuine and uneasy watch throughout. His score for Sicario was one of the tensest in modern cinema, with *The Beast* being one of my personal favourites. I also love his lighter scores for Arrival and The Theory of Everything and I\'m super hyped to see what he can do in the new Blade Runner film.\r\n\r\n- Tyler Bates: An interesting addition to this list because he\'s probably only here for two films, in the John Wick duo. His music for John Wick is some of my favourite film music ever, replacing the more common orchestral or electronic scores with something truly innovative, but something that works so perfectly, within and outside of the film. The guitars, drums and synths create for some genuinely awesome pieces, including *Assassins* and *John Wick Reckoning*, that are genuinely addictive and heighten the action by a hefty amount. \r\n\r\n- Thomas Newman: This guy is the king of making you cry! His sombre but yet uplifting score in The Shawshank Redemption is probably his most memorable but my all-time favourite of his is from Road to Perdition. The theme, which is played over the final battle, is a truly epic piece of cinema. His work in Skyfall is also very epic, with some awesome synth cues, and one of the most awesome pieces of all time (Tennyson!)\r\n\r\n- Justin Herwitz: A more modern composer, this guy has created some of the sweetest, most addictive soundtracks of the last couple years. His work on Whiplash and La La Land is awesome, with the latter being my favourite score of 2016. *Another Day of Sun* and *City of Stars* are truly addictive pieces of music that I could listen to and sing along too all day long.\r\n\r\n- David Arnold: This guy I love partly for his Bond outings, Casino Royale in particular, where he blended the Bond theme with You Know My Name perfectly into some heavily motif driven music, that is at it\'s best in *African Rundown.* But my favourite of his work comes from Sherlock, with The Final Problem having some of the saddest music in TV.\r\n\r\n- Murray Gold: Steering away from films for a moment, his work on Doctor Who is breathtaking, carrying the show\'s score for over 10 years now, and never missing a beat. Tracks like *This Is Gallifrey* are masterful, and he\'s the king of leitmotifs and character themes.\r\n\r\n- Ramin Djawadi: Another TV master, his work on Game of Thrones, Prison Break and Westworld is admirable, with emphasis on the latter. The saloon-piano covers of classic songs such as *Black Hole Sun* and *Back to Black* are really, really clever and great to listen too.\r\n\r\n- James Newton Howard: Nightcrawler is another one of my favourite\'s music wise. The riff-heavy guitars are perfect at pronouncing the character in question. Also worked wonderfully with Hans Zimmer on the Dark Knight trilogy, and did some great work on Blood Diamond!\r\n\r\n- Harry Gregson-Williams: My last pick is some maybe a little more lesser known, but who\'s work is still brilliant. I first heard his work in Phone Booth and binge watched a bunch of his movies the same day, discovering incredible works in The Martian and Unstoppable. \r\n\r\nThose are my picks, what are yours? Any other commentary\'s on film scores and soundtracks, excited to discuss what\'s going on. What film music are you looking forward too in the coming months? Hans Zimmer\'s Dunkirk and Jóhann Jóhannsson\'s Blade Runner 2049 are the ones I\'ll be looking out for but I\'m also excited for the Baby Driver soundtrack and how it\'ll combine music and film!

It remains one of my favorite animated films of all time what with its dark and scary atmosphere, heart warming story of a mother trying to save her son, and legit moments of terror and suspense.\r\n\r\nAs I think back upon this film, I have to ask the question: What happened to animated Dramas for kids? We\'re in this age where children\'s movies are pandering to the lowest denominator. Where fart and piss jokes are what pass as entertainment. \r\n\r\nI feel that the industry is cheating children from movies that carry a deeper and more meaningful message. We got this with Zootopia, a comedy with dramatic elements, but it is so few and far between.\r\n\r\nI miss movies made for kids but carried mature themes that showed that singing and dancing do not always make the world a better place. I miss movies like All Dogs Go To Heaven where the main character is a drinking, gambling, con artist who learns to love someone else and ends up sacrificing everything for that person. That is real character development! Seeing Charlie go from using the girl for money to sacrificing his life to save her is a huge process. Not to mention the nightmarish visions of hell that he suffered through showing his own fears and regrets.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr how in Land Before Time, the kids did not really get along right away. They argued, bickered, and annoyed one another and it was through their loneliness and journey that they became true friends and a family.\r\n\r\nSecret of Nimh - the mother\'s tireless journey through the scary world around her in order to save her son...\r\n\r\nEven Black Cauldron with it\'s fantasy setting and overcoming odds greater than your own...\r\n\r\n\r\nThese movies contained humor, and some even songs (All Dogs), but they all contained mature themes that showed true character growth and development. Sure some of the moments were scary (The hell scene in All Dogs was nightmare fuel), but all the scenes were part of a greater, bigger story. And like adult dramas, not every one of these movies had a happy ending. Sometimes characters died and a tear or song would not bring them back. Sometimes badguys actually killed characters you loved...\r\n\r\nWhen I see movies like TROLLS rely mostly on pop references, music, and fart/piss jokes to entertain kids, it just makes me wish that the old Children Dramas would make a comeback...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, /r/movies?

I think we all saw that coming, but I noticed something on the second viewing...the role Sylvia plays in this movie and what she represents for the director.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we first get introduced to Sylvia she\'s seen sitting with Patrick\'s friends in the living room as they console him after his father died. The friends try to make it light and joke around with Patrick, whereas Sylvia chastises them for doing so in such a sad time in his life, even though Patrick seems to enjoy joking around in such a troubling time. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this movie has going for it is the realistic way it portrays everyday life. The plot unfolds in such a naturalistic way you forget you\'re watching a fiction because it does such a good job at resembling everyday life, from the random quietness that can occur in the middle of a car ride to the dark humor sprinkled into everyday conversation. Sylvia represents the unnatural. She is driven by the need for things to be the way she thinks they should be, rather than as they are. That is why she ruins a perfectly good moment with Patrick and his friends, because in her eyes what should be is more important than what is. In my opinion she is the antagonist not only to Patrick but also to the movie itself, who\'s main aim is to present tragedy as it is, and not as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis theory is supported further by the next time we see Sylvia. The second interaction with Sylvia is the next morning when she goes to the kitchen to make breakfast while Lee is talking on the phone making funeral arrangements.  She walks into the kitchen and chastises Lee for making funeral arrangements in front of Patrick, something Patrick didn\'t seem to mind. Additionally, Lee was in the kitchen first, so Sylvia walked into Lee\'s private conversation and told him to leave. It\'s just another example where Sylvia tries to change a situation because she thinks it should be approached differently. She tries to change the natural environment into what she thinks it should look like rather than what it does look like. \r\n\r\nTaken together, these two examples show someone who tries to deny what is real for what they think should be real. Of all the characters we encounter, she is the only one who consistently invalidates others because how they are interacting does no meet her expectations of what is okay in this unique situation Patrick has found himself. I believe the director used Sylvia partly as a device in this movie to represent the major problem with this genre itself...they so often reject real reactions to grief because it doesn\'t feel like that\'s how someone should be responding. Often there is no humor in movies with tragedy as a theme because tragedy shouldn\'t be associated with humor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s why Sylvia is so important in this movie. She represents what is wrong with this genre, and the director is showing it through her character. We expect sad movies to be sad, with very little humor, however that is not usually how life is, that is just the black and white way movies portray it. Why? Because so often we get fixated on how things should be and thereby reject how things are. We do it in relationships all the time. Sylvia, who represents this sentiment, shows how much of a mistake this way of thinking is...she often disrupts the natural flow of the plot because it doesn\'t meet her expectations of how the plot should be going. Ironically, by expressing this sentiment she shows why it is such a harmful one to have. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo often movies that are dramas are so narrowly focused on the genre itself they forget that everyday life still happens even in a tragedy. Even Hitler farted every once in a while. But when a movie attempts to capture this reality of ambiguity it is often met with criticism. People like black and white. Sad movies should be sad movies, and funny movies should be funny. I think Sylvia is so important because she serves as a contrast to the movie itself, a reminder of what the movie isn\'t...a rejection of honesty in order to meet what we expect - a sad boy and a sad confused uncle with nothing else. \r\n\r\n','The Kitchen',5,0,'2017-07-05 16:11:52'),('6ljtdc','MCU News: Captain Marvel\'s Co-Star, Spidey\'s Five-Film Plan and Tony Stark Talks Leaving','','Captain Marvel',0,1,'2017-07-06 01:48:15'),('6lqj61','Why are so many of the top grossing films each year average or mediocre?','Before you read the rest please note that this isn\'t criticism directed towards Hollywood but rather the trends of audiences (which could be the catalyst of Hollywood\'s decisions but that\'s another post).\r\n\r\nIt seems as if quality and effort don\'t pay off much anymore. Movies like Despicable Me 3 make a billion dollars worldwide yet works of genius like Baby Driver only make a sliver (not even in some cases) of that? And don\'t get me started on crap like Transformers making 10 times that of Kubo and the Two Strings (for example) or a Pitch Perfect opening higher than Mad Max: Fury Road.\r\n\r\nIs it an indictment of the taste of the public? Or the intelligence of the public? I know quality is said to be subjective but there are clear cut factors that objectively make some films better than others (by a landslide even). I feel bad for these filmmakers who put genuine passion into their work only to be completely overshadowed by formulaic shit.\r\n\r\nI don\'t mean to sound incredibly cynical because there are box office juggernauts that I enjoy greatly (Star Wars, Zootopia, Titanic, Harry Potter, hell even a few Marvel films) but those are merely films that were made for quality first that happened to become massive hits, often as a result of that quality that translates into word of mouth. Just look at Illumination: Minions, Secret Life of Pets, and Sing aren\'t the worst but have almost no genuine effort out into them, feeling a ton like the work of an algorithm, yet they ranged from $600 million-1 billion worldwide, and I don\'t get why; there are many other (better) kids films out there and none of the three got stellar reviews.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is going on too long, but it\'s something that infuriates me.

It uses both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson correctly comedically, unlike their other films like Get Hard and The Best Man. (No serious spoilers that aren\'t in the trailer)','I think everyone is tired of the Kevin Hart costars with a white guy out of touch movie. \r\n\r\nAnd Dwayne Johnson is often the foil in other movies with 10-20% charismatic humor. \r\n\r\nCentral Intelligence smartly uses both as equal parts ridiculous and foil, showing the comedic skills of both....Which most comedic actors admit is really hard. Seth Rogen always plays the dry, acerbic foil usually paired with someone absurd, like James Franco or Zac Efron or the rest of the cast of This is the End. James Franco is pretty much never the foil but the comedic act, whether it was in Spring Breakers, Pineapple Express, The Interview, or This is the End. (I\'d say Jonah hill probably is the most versatile playing both). \r\n\r\nAnyway, Hart and Johnson elevate each other by playing both parts of the double act -- so you don\'t know where the comedy will come from in any scene. \r\n\r\n**Premise**\r\n\r\nJohnson\'s character (Bob) was an obese loser who was severely bullied (really really bad even for a movie) in high school but now looks like the Rock and works for the CIA but is emotionally stuck in HS back in the 90s, and wears jorts, unicorn shirts, and even a fanny pack. Just about all his catch phrases and slang is from the 90s, so **basically if you were old enough to remember 1996 it\'s a big nostalgia trip as the soundtrack is all from that year and done well**. \r\n\r\nHart\'s character (Calvin) was the homecoming king, most popular guy, had the prettiest girlfriend, was student body president in HS, and was the only student nice to the Rock in Hs, and the Rock really does cringe humor well as he\'s been obsessed about Hart as his only friend for 20 years post high school, and it\'s super awkward and funny.  \r\n\r\nBut both characters went separate directions after graduating. Bob lost the weight and gained muscles and joined the CIA.

Since the story is about Michael Corleone seeking redemption, I kept expecting the movie to end with him performing some redeeming act. But we just get a bummer of an ending where Mary is killed with a bullet intended for Michael. It would have been more logical for Michael to sacrifice himself saving Mary from something. The movie is basically a long, circular journey from Michael feeling guilty about killing Fredo to Michael feeling guilty about Mary dying. \r\n\r\nThe ending scene with the dog is bizarre. I mean, somewhere between parts II and III, Michael had become a moral person. He actually tried to legitimize the business and protect his family. He JUST HAPPENED not to succeed.

I\'ve seen it 4-5 times, recommended it to many of my friends. I waited JW2 so much. I was disappointed when I saw it in the theaters and I am currently rewatching it, and still disappointed. They lost so much that was good in the first one, and I don\'t understand the praise the sequel gets. \r\n\r\nI think the main problem with Chapter Two is that it lost the character driven mentality of the first one. In first one, everything made sense, even in a twisted way. Characters and their actions made sense in the world they lived in. Assassin killing 119 men to kill a man who killed his puppy, which he got from his dying wife? I get it. Russian mafia boss being scared sh*tless by him, but still going to war against him, to save his son, yeah, I can understand. \r\n\r\nBut in the sequel, the idea is lost from the get-go. One Russian mobsters ask his boss: Why don\'t we give back his car that was stolen, instead of packing up and leaving? Boss answers in non-sequitur way something about John Wick being determined and focused. Yeah, to get his car back, not to kill or wound random Russian goons. And John Wick even calls the boss to say they have his car. Why does he call? What? \r\n\r\nEDIT: And when John gets his car and escapes, the Russian goons go after him to stop him? Why? I understand that Viggo could not go back, otherwise his son would die, but to die over a car? Against the deadliest assassin? Why didn\'t the mob boss instruct his men NOT to go after John Wick if/when he takes his car back? He just wants to be ruined? \r\n\r\nThen there is John Wick\'s reputation. Everyone knew him in the first movie. He made impossible tasks. Everyone knew not to f*ck with him, except the boy who wasn\'t around when he was working. And in the sequel Santino BACKSTABS him?! Despite working with him, and knowing what he is capable of? Okay, maybe he is really arrogant and stupid, but that goes against everything we learned in the first movie, which is: Don\'t mess with John Wick. Everyone knows this! This is one thing Santino should know. That John Wick does what is impossible. \r\n\r\nAnd the third thing. In the first movie John Wick triumphs because he is SO GOOD. And because Marcus helped him a couple of times. Viggo throws everything he has against him, and Wick wins because he is determined and without peers in his craft. Which is killing. \r\n\r\nIn the second movie, many of John Wick\'s triumphs come down to the fact that he has bullet-proof jacket and others don\'t. And suddenly, the bad guys have really bad aim, which is the cardinal sin of action movies, and one thing that JW1 was not guilty of. Bad guys did not fail to kill John because they could not aim. They could not kill John because John outsmarted or outmaneuvered them. \r\n\r\nBut alas, in the sequel we have a scene (timecode: 1:41:00) where John is wrestling with a man, another goon comes up, lines up a perfect headshot to mostly motionless John, AND MISSES ALL OF THE SHOTS. John turns around and shoots him. \r\n\r\nNot all is bad in the movie, it is still adequate sequel to a great movie, but how did this movie get so many rave reviews, is beyond me.

Fassbender and Kurzel for Assassin\'s Creed). As a player and a movie enthousiast, I have never fellt that those movies were up to the task. I know that the hollywood majors are looking for content that has already proven successful to adapt. however, I don\'t really understand the angle of the video game developers as we have seen countless video game movies (for lack of a better name) fail in the last 10 to 15 years (reviews and/or box office).\r\n\r\nWhat\'s your take on this ever growing trend?\r\n\r\nI have read a lot on the subject (as should you when you are writing a thesis on a subject I guess :)) and I have found interesting to study the reaction from movie enthousiasts to the many (many) releases of video game movies.

Here are my impressions!','As a big fan of the manga and anime, I must say that it\'s hard for me to review a piece like this. The team that helm the movie doesn\'t seen to have any will to please the fans, but to make Death Note susceptible to all the public. The basic plot and the name of characters are there, but that is it.\r\n\r\nIs it bad? Well, not really. You won\'t be disappointed as in The Last Airbender because they are different takes on the story. It\'s like comparing How To Train Your Dragon book and movie. \r\n\r\nBoth actors are just... Meh. They look much older than the characters who they\'re playing and the acting is VERY forced sometimes. If you are a fan of L and his eccentricity, you\'ll be disappointed. L is sensitive and cool, while Light isn\'t the super genius guy who we are used to. Beyond that, the movie takes itself too seriously most of the times, which is distracting. \r\n\r\nRyuk is pretty much the perfect take of the character. He\'s scary, super realistic and Dafoe does an amazing job. Loved Mia and I would prefer her to be the main character and Kyra, since she\'s a much more interesting character than Light (now that would be different).\r\n\r\nIt could be so much more, but because the movie is around the two main bland characters, the experience comes a little empty. The experience would be probably better if you don\'t have any contact to the source material.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a 6/10 for me.\r\n','Yesterday',359,192,'2017-07-22 12:43:28'),('6p1odj','Do you judge a film based largely on its closing scenes?','I want to write a longer post about a film I just saw and don\'t want to spoil either the film or the delivery, so I\'m leaving my specific impetus for thinking about this out of the conversation, but basically-\r\n\r\n I saw a film last night that I really loved and engaged with, but that had such a nonsense, inconsistent-with-the-film, poorly put together last ten minutes/two scenes that it honestly made me wonder if it had been written and directed by completely different people, possibly children as opposed to the experienced cast that was actually involved.

That seems fine on a personal level, but also feels unjustified in terms of evaluating the film as a piece of art that was put together with the intention of being a coherent whole. Do you, or can you, judge a film with a large weight on its closing? It feels like it\'s supposed to be the high note that leaves the viewer with the summation of the film and its artistic intention, but it also feels unfair to not excuse a couple poor choices just because of their location in the script (like how being permissive toward missteps midway through the film feels more common).

The general consensus among the critics of the last act is that it is Home Alone for adults. While on the surface level it seems true, but I would argue that it was fantastic. I present a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Firstly, it was an excellent way to add to the legend of Bond. Main hero takes on a powerful villain at his own fortress, where he has the best chance to beat him. Skyfall lodge is shown to be well positioned in case of an attack happens. You get a clear 360 degree view of all sides and can plan in advance on how to deal with the enemy. Plus you have an underground passage leading to the chapel, through which you can  trap the enemy in either of the buildings. Also, Bond assumed he would get access to a lot of ammo which belonged to the family. Hence, it seemed to be a viable plan.\r\n\r\n2) The reason Bond did not get help from MI 6 was his revenge on M. It is an important theme running in the film of how M treats her agents. It was on her call that Bond got hit atvthe start, hence implying how disposable agents are to M. Bond realised this, especially after learning about Silvas past, and now was using M as bait to attract Silva. Of course, he thought he would defeat Silva and save M, but in a way he treated M, just like she treats her agents.\r\n\r\n3) The lack of ammo, reduced Bond to make booby traps and such, hence the comparisons to Home Alone. Although it was slightly unrealistic, but it was a great way to show that Bond was a tactician as well. He was put in an unusual position where he did not have enough guns, which he knows perfectly how to use. Thus, in this situation it reflected that Bond was not just a hitman, but can make use of whatever resources to deal with any situation. \r\n\r\nYes there are minor plot conveniences, such as the torch scene. But in an act of desperation, amd technically a battle situation, mistakes are made plenty.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought it was a terrific way to pay homage to the iconic character, by bringing him back to his roots. And with the great way he fought the battle + motivation to beat Sillva , we get our good old Bond back who became rusty during the start of the film.

Anyway, my waiting time is over. I finally saw it! I absolutely loved it.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, ‘he’ murdered his entire family as they slept in a haunted house, in Amityville, but 40 years later, a single mother that moves her three children into that the same house.\r\n\r\nThis movie is terrific, crazy and scary with some creepy moments. But yet, it’s a lot of fun to watch. It has great jump scares! I found the twists incredibly crazy.\r\n\r\nOne thing in this movie made me surprise is that they showed the actual Amityville DVDs (the original, Amityville II: The Possession and the remake) and I loved how they showed it in this Amityville movie lol. They said new versions are boring, so they picked the original to watch and some of the characters watched it on TV. ?\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about the characters:\r\n\r\nBella Thorne gave a likeable character, good acting and she showed her emotional moments. She wasn’t dumb, neither annoying. She seemed awesome when she was fighting with the demon in the last scene.\r\n\r\nJennifer Jason Leigh gives a creepy performance. She played really crazy mother who already knew about the \'Amityville Horror\' murders and she thought everything would be better in a possessed house in Amityville, but she was also good. She did a good job.\r\n\r\nCameron Monaghan was really creepy as looking. He was easily the best and creepiest part of the movie.\r\n\r\nIt’s not for everyone, but if you waited to see it in a long time, you should to see it if you want. Since you need a time for this movie to release.\r\n\r\nI\'d give it a 9.5/10.','Fighting with My Family',0,11,'2017-08-05 13:00:16'),('6rw3e6','About the ending of the Hunt/Jagten (spoiler)','Fantastic movie, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. However, and maybe this was discussed before but I didn\'t read the theories to keep my original thoughts: maybe they pulled a Black Mirror - White bear on us. Maybe the whole point was to make us empathize with someone guilty but who\'s so convincing at looking innocent that even we are fooled.\r\n\r\n A few things make me think this: first, the last scene. I\'m totally overthinking it but maybe he remembered Theo\'s threat and knowing he\'s guilty, he was haunted by this sword of Damocles that Theo could trigger any time if he found out the truth.\r\n\r\n Another thing is Carla not being coherent. Maybe she didn\'t dream what she confessed, but instead what happened to her was what made her have those dreams and get her thoughts confused.\r\n\r\n The part about the basement kinda confused me for how matter-of-fact it was. I thought there was gonna be some revelation or plot twist about it but no.\r\n\r\n Fanny barking at Kirsten\'s name too was a bit weird. Again, maybe I\'m overthinking it, but I thought it was gonna have some kind of impact instead of just being a way to show the marriage didn\'t end well.\r\n\r\n Or ... Maybe it was to show that both Fanny and Marcus decided to go with Lucas instead of his wife, maybe hinting at him actually being innocent and genuine.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: maybe we were fooled into thinking Lucas is innocent.\r\n\r\n Anyway, I\'d love to hear your thoughts on all this.

It\'s an horror epic about friendship, the power of memory, and the true meaning of home. I absolutely adore IT. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I hate the old miniseries with a burning passion. So much different than the books, it\'s tone is all over the place, Henry Bowers is laughably horrible in it(older Henry bowers- where he returns for one second lol) and it\'s just a cringe worthy piece of shit. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I\'m super excited about the new movie. It looks fucking spectacular. Pennywise looks terrifying/badass, it has that \'epic\' feel to it, and the kids look perfectly cast. I truly am not worried whatsoever and my complaint below is just extremely minor. \r\n\r\nTHAT BEING SAID...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone who read the books ever remember pennywise being legit funny? Like saying something to make you laugh? The miniseries did this so much it made me wanna kill myself. They made him tell so many jokes to the point where it was silly and stupid. I didn\'t even laugh once...I wanted to be scared, not hear jokes from this terrifying beast \r\n\r\nIn the new trailer, when Pennywise is on the tv with the kids chanting \'kill them all! Kill them all!\' I broke a smile and actually laughed. Then I stopped and said hey wait a moment...King never really had him actually be funny in the book. He was mostly this serious, scary, horrifying creature. If he would tell a joke it would be disturbing because the situation it was in was life or death for some young innocent kid. \r\n\r\nAm I remembering things correctly, was Pennywise never really something to make you laugh in the original novel? If they have him be a bit funny at times in the movie it\'s fine, but I really hope they don\'t go overboard with the humor. I mean I genuinely found that TV scene with the chanting in the tv spot funny, but the source of the humor should really come from the kids, just as it did in the book. The mini series tried making Pennywise funny and that\'s part of what makes it so awful. \r\n\r\nAgain, I\'m not worried about the overall quality of the film whatsoever and this is an very minor nitpick. So yeah, anyone else hoping he\'s not too funny here? Am I remembering the book wrong?

Loved it! What really struck me about this version wasn’t the action sequences (although they’re as epic as ever), but the clarity of the closeups and the 3D effect on incidental details.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen T2 many times, but mostly on bog-standard TVs – I last saw it at the cinema in ’91 on its original release.\r\n\r\nThe 3D in movies tends to fade into the background for me after about 20 minutes, so the pre/title sequence had the biggest ‘wow’ factor. The flaming swings, Terminator’s face looming out of the fire and even the hazy freeway shot had an impact. During the big set pieces? Not so much.\r\n\r\nThe 3D did give me a sense of immediacy. At John’s adoptive home, I stood next to the T-1000 looking over Todd’s shoulder at the clock in the room behind him. The brake-light plastic blown from the patrol car outside Cyberdyne Systems landed at my feet. The trash whipped up by the time-travel electrical storm swirled around my head. Despite being a well-watched movie, it felt the story was now no longer a warm fuzzy memory, but something happening right now in front of me.\r\n\r\nThe level of detail (the 4K effect?) on the characters in closeup blew me away – on Sarah Connor in particular. Her muscle definition as she does pull ups is a sight to behold. As is the hair on her arms before the dream sequence, and the sweat on her skin afterwards. The detail around her eyes as she stands over Miles Dyson during the aborted assassination attempt gave me a far greater appreciation of her acting ability.\r\n\r\nI didn’t feel the 3D glasses made the movie too dark, and the 4K/clean up process made it look brand new. The 3D was implemented extremely well – so much so that it wasn’t actually noticeable at times, and that’s fine.\r\n\r\nIf you’re ambivalent about the Stereoscopic update I’ll counter: *It’s Terminator 2 on the big screen*.

I\'m especially disappointed in James Wan and his poor ability to make a solid movie. He has this repetitive trend of starting with a promising intro, but gives up midway through so that the second half of his film looks like an accidental parody of the original script. This can be seen in both the Conjuring 1 & 2: In the first movie, the haunted mother (IIRC), starts having flashbacks of happy family moments during her exorcism and finally presides over the demon thanks to the power of love, as if this wasn\'t cheesy enough. In the sequel, we\'re shown some genuine realism before James Wan fucks up again and decides to have a scene where that old mannequin-looking man with a cane makes his grand appearance in front of everyone in the living room. More shit like this keeps happening in the Paranormal Activity series (though I have some favourite scenes). I want something coherent and as realistic as possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, no offense, but I have no interest in movies where tryhard actors scream at the top of their lungs in the hopes of getting that Oscar.

Having now watched all three films in his \'Apartment Trilogy\' (_Repulsion_, _Rosemary\'s Baby_ and _The Tenant_) I\'m in awe at how seemingly effortlessly he creates tension and taps in to the very real fears of modern society. \r\n\r\nPerhaps one of his lesser-known films but still a masterpiece none-the-less, _The Tenant_ stars Polanski himself as Trelkovsky, a Polish émigré living in Paris. Trelkovsky rents an apartment in a dilapidated building down town only to discover that the former tenant, Simone Choule, committed suicide by throwing herself out the apartment window in to the courtyard below. He reluctantly agrees to occupy the deceased woman\'s home but soon finds that his neighbours treat him with a mix of disdain and suspicion. \r\n\r\nWhat unfolds is a tale of paranoia and suspense that feels all too familiar to fans of Polanski\'s work but like the other films in his \'Apartment Trilogy\' all of the aspects, though we\'ve seen them before, are executed flawlessly. Polanski once again plays with our concept of reality, forcing us to witness events through the eyes and fractured psyche of our protagonist as they\'re driven slowly insane. \r\n\r\nIn _The Tenant_ Polanski, himself a Polish immigrant living abroad, deals with the struggle of the individual living in an alien society. The need to conform permeates our every interaction and threatens our very identity. This is expressed perfectly in _The Tenant_ through Trelkovsky who is slowly transformed in to the deceased Simone through the machinations of his neighbours who chastise him for the smallest of transgressions. Every sign of individuality and non-conformity is stamped out until only the familiar remain. \r\n\r\nThe common thread that connects all of Polanski\'s \'Apartment Trilogy\' films is the horror of urban living. The apartment, seen by many as the last refuge of the individual, our personal sanctuary away from the outside world, is constant under threat from the outside world. People force their way in to our protagonists\' apartments and thus their lives. It is telling of the condition of modern society that is constantly pitting the individual up against society as a whole. \r\n\r\nI\'d heartily recommend _The Tenant_, and all of Polanski\'s \'Apartment Trilogy\'. They are some of the best horror films I\'ve seen but they will also appeal to regular film fans due to their lack of jump scares, blood and gore.

To my luck the official discussion must have just closed, there\'s posts less than a month old! Anyways I kind of wanted to address many of those posts from my take on the movie for discussing. Obviously spoilers abound freely.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest complaints that comes up is the ending, which seemingly came out of nowhere. This is how I felt until my last viewing, though I liked the Phantom imagery whether it made sense or not. But honestly I think the ending fits perfectly. For example, another complaint is that the twist isn\'t even that twisty, as it\'s obvious the director is the Barron. This is upsetting if you went in like me expecting another Shutter Island, but in reality this is very much a movie in the vein of Dracula and Phantom of the Opera. Ask yourself, was there ever a time you thought Dracula or the Phantom were supposed to be heroes? Even Gerard Butler\'s romantic, attractive movie phantom was always known to be a negative presence in the tale, and that\'s how the Barron is treated here. \r\n\r\nI originally agreed that the movie seemed to shift from a Shutter Island to a Phantom of the Opera, but I now think it was an old school horror from the start, as well as possibly the best Lovecraft movie ever. In fact, a user in the official discussion, /u/KentContrereas , came up with probably the best theory I\'ve seen on the movie. I will link to this at the end. Basically the eels are not mindless animals, they are a deity or a force of nature, something with goal driven intelligence. It explains how the Barron could count on Lockhart\'s car accident - the eels were controlling the animal like what would have happened to the poor cow. The patients attack Lockhart like zombies because they are controlled by the eels and protecting their vessels from leaving. They work with the Barron because he provides them bodies. And Lockhart wasn\'t force fed eels simply for the shock, it makes perfect sense if the amount of eels is related to the level of control. He wasn\'t drinking as much water or going in the pools, they had to speed up the process before he got away. \r\n\r\nAnyways, let the man speak for himself, he\'s a genius! https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5uju5i/official_discussion_a_cure_for_wellness_spoilers/diz1kjj/\r\n\r\nMoving on from this, were the eels a hallucination? I don\'t think they were in any situation, absolutely none. They were in the isolation tank, they were in the cow, they were under the skin, and they were even in the toilet. Remember, these aren\'t dumb animals, but possibly highly intelligent and organized. It seems their simple presence in water has an effect on people as well, which is why they enter the isolation chamber. The cow drank eel water and they grew in her, same as the people. And they were in the toilet because they were attempting to drive Lockhart insane at that point. \r\n\r\nBut if the have a deal with the Barron, why eat him? Well for one he was dead and therefore useless to them. Yet I think there was more to in than that. As discussed in the above theory, if the eels are intelligent and comparable to an entity of weird fiction, perhaps the eels simply came to realize Lockhart was superior to the Barron and would be their new main incarnation. This explains the evil ending grin better than Lockhart simply being happy/crazy. And yes, btw his teeth come back because they were fake teeth put in while Lockhart was under control of the eels. Since people can obviously still break through the eel control (the several false endings, Pembroke agreeing to return to New York randomly), they need to keep the patients looking healthy so they don\'t question what\'s happing to them. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, what about the Barron\'s obsession with his bloodline? Honestly if you\'re familiar with certain European ideologies you\'re aware that blood purity was simply something people obsessed about, culminating in some of the attrocities committed last century. But with all the other crazy stuff happening, it seems like there must be more to the bloodline than that. Honestly I\'m not sure, but I\'m starting to think the Barron was somehow more closely related to the eels than is let on. I mean the entire cult treats him in the way you\'d expect a pope, a king, perhaps even pharaoh. Plus it\'s entirely possible that the eels were using the Barron rather than the other way around, getting bodies to inhabit, a rich source of fresh food, and perhaps it was them trying to create a new bloodline. In fact, this could be why the eels treat Hannah with almost a type of reverence in the pool. \r\n\r\nAnyways I\'ll cut this here, I thought the movie was above and beyond fantastic. The twist of the whole thing was precisely that it was played up like Shutter Island, but was actually a monster movie of sci-fi immortality and Lovecraftian gods.

I’m going to try to write about both, especially since I adored *First Reformed*, but I ended up having a lot to say about *The Shape of Water*, so it\'s possible I\'ll only have time to put down my thoughts for it today. \r\n\r\n***The Shape of Water***\r\n\r\nGuillermo del Toro is back after the unenthusiastic reception of his previous film, *Crimson Peak*. His career seems to be haunted by the ever-echoing achievement of his obviously greatest film, *Pan’s Labyrinth*; like the work of other artists who have been unfortunate enough to catch lightning in their bottle, his following films have all been cursed to be judged by one chimerical metric: whether or not they are a “return to form.” \r\n\r\nBut, you know, has he finally made that film? There at least appears to be an attempt. The premise is similarly a fairy tale of sorts: a mute woman, played by Sally Hawkins, secretly befriends a monster who is treated inhumanely at the facility where she works as a janitor. She conspires with her gay neighbor (performed modestly by Richard Jenkins) to set him free; somewhere along the way, she falls in love with the creature, and from there it doesn’t take a genius to predict the narrative beats.  \r\n\r\nOf course, with a film like this, we aren’t so concerned with the narrative as the execution itself. The film takes place in Baltimore in the 1960s, and del Toro’s interpretation of the era is fresh. There’s no free love in the air here, no acoustic strumming or Beatnick rhapsodies. Instead, the atmosphere is dreary in its whimsy, mildly Burtonesque even. It’s not exactly as dystopian as Richard Ayoade’s *The Double*, but the set pieces have had the life sucked out of them all the same. \r\n\r\nAnd this is by design – the thematic backdrop for this misunderstood-monster romance is the hatred of the 60s: racism, homophobia, misogyny. The greatest nightmare of all is the nostalgia for torturous times, and del Toro does something cinematically useful by lending his dark touch to this period.  \r\n\r\nBut short of Sally Hawkin’s and Michael Stuhlbarg’s unsurprisingly stellar performances, the film is otherwise, in my mind, a flop. Talent is undoubtedly wasted here. Michael Shannon plays the villain, but where you might expect del Toro to encourage Shannon to delve into the creepier qualities that make him magnetic as an actor, all you get is, what’s at this point in his career, a by-the-numbers performance. Similarly, Octavia Spencer reaches for the stars, bravely daring her soul to play the role of the sassy black sidekick. \r\n\r\nHowever, the most egregious misfire in the movie is the romance itself. It’s not even something as tactless as how often the film smacks your head with its dialogic baton, trying to beat the sense into you that, duh dummie, the monster is a *metaphor* for societal phobias. It’s something much more ethically dubious, a concern that makes me question whether del Toro has ever even been in love before. \r\n\r\nSince Hawkins’ character is mute, she communicates with sign language. So, upon meeting the monster (who at the beginning has no means for verbal communication), Hawkins starts to teach him speech by signing words – at first, she signs the word “egg” as she gives him an egg, he repeats the sign, she becomes delighted at his reciprocation, she signs a new word and so on.  We get two scenes of this and something of a montage before she pleads to her neighbor to help her free him, since the monster sees and understands her in a way that no one has before. Hawkins acts the shit out of this scene, so much so that you basically believe her. \r\n\r\nBut it’s not as if by this point she and the monster are exchanging vulnerabilities, talking deeply about their deepest dreams and fears. In fact, there is no evidence throughout the entire movie that their linguistic universe is larger than 10 words. For reference, my dog responds to roughly 10 commands. And though I love my dog completely, I would have to be a seriously diseased person to think he understands me in a way that could set the stage for a romantic relationship.\r\n\r\nIf that’s not concerning enough, consider that the monster’s behavior isn’t one that resembles a silent but nonetheless matured adult: he’s more like a bumbling child, or a loyal pet. Once Hawkins secures him in his apartment, he eats a cat and runs away. When Hawkins retrieves him again, he shows off how his skin can glow and then tries to fondle her breasts. She resists at first, but then, well, she fucks him. \r\n\r\nBy this point, we are supposed to solidly believe that these two are in love. The characters do at least. When she tells her cohorts in crime that she has done the deed, they essentially laugh it off as a “weird, but I guess it makes sense” scenario. When Jenkins later opens a door to accidentally catch the couple in the act, he leans his head on the frame, admiring the lovemaking. \r\n\r\nIn terms of cinematic ethics, this troubles me. Language is essential to, if anything, consent. As a society, we don’t ascribe the capacity to consent to lifeforms such as animals or children precisely because their linguistic abilities aren’t developed enough. And seriously, there was more inter-species communication in the Koko the Gorilla documentary. \r\n\r\nAt best, it\'s just an unconvincing romance. But I really suspect that at its bones, this is a bittersweet story about the joys of molestation. Which would have been fine, intriguing even, had the film in any imaginable way addressed it. But in its folkloric ambitions, it flamboyantly skirts by this conundrum in a blazing moral blunder. And a blunder it is: if the monster really does represent our unrighteous social fears, but its speech and behavior represents the intelligence of a child, what exactly are you saying about oppressed minority classes? \r\n\r\nThe significance of the film’s title is revealed in the end – love is like water that you cannot see, but submerges you, shapes to you, and surrounds your body entirely. Sadly, the movie itself is a shallower experience. In fact, you know its shape. You’ve seen a puddle.

Their ubiquity placed them at the forefront of blockbusters for an entire decade, but I think the main reasons for their success was the audience’s attachment to the main three characters and how a generation grew up with them. It’s totally unique, and it’s one of the reasons why I wanted to look closer at my favourite of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe The Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film. It’s a certainly a great Harry Potter movie, even though many fans feel it betrays the book. It’s a great fantasy movie. And most of all, it’s a great coming of age movie.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI remember even as a kid losing faith in the Harry Potter movies after seeing the first two. I was a huge fan of the books and, while being faithful to the events depicted in the novels, the first two movies were missing …*something*. I knew at the time that the movies had the potential to be better, I just didn’t know how. Then I remember watching The Prisoner of Azkaban, and everything felt just *right*. The music was better than ever, and the Hogwarts grounds were [wild and rocky](https://i.imgur.com/iUk8UAf.png), the way I imagined it, and the way everything seemed to flow more smoothly created a non-stop feeling of fun, magical fantasy. I went to IMDB and noticed that there was a new director: Alfonso Cuaron. I wondered if the change in tone was due to this new director, or if it could be something else. I was disappointed that he didn’t direct any of the others, and when I watched them I appreciated how influential his visual style was over the rest of the series, even though I don’t think any others quite captured the pure joy of spending time in this world. Prisoner of Azkaban was also the movie that led me down a path that eventually led to the discoveries of many international filmmakers and helped me understand just how important a good director really is.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, this was an important film for me, both as a fan of Harry Potter and as a budding fan of movies, but seeing it today reminds me just how fun and magical this movie truly is. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the very opening scene, there is a newfound fluidity with the camera, and the mischievous sense of humour from the books is reinstalled, as Harry, now a teenager, practices spells with his wand underneath his [bed sheets](https://i.imgur.com/9pI28X2.png). The magical world feels more tangible than ever with an increased use of practical effects and long takes. I love the ways in which the camera moves around Hogwarts, establishing the castle as the [beautiful and mysterious](https://i.imgur.com/m6Ako5v.png) place that it is. The ghosts and portraits are given little moments to shine, but mostly hang around in the background, the minutiae of everyday life. This may also be the most fantastical of them all; with the establishment of [werewolves](https://i.imgur.com/17Uk14a.png), hippogriffs, [dementors](https://i.imgur.com/EXo9S4I.png), animagi, and boggarts. None of the other movies quite gave this world the attention and love this one does. The young actors are growing into their roles, delivering the best performances they would give in the series. And a handful of world-class actors are added to the cast in supporting roles; including Gary Oldman, David Thewlis (in my favourite performance in the entire series), Timothy Spall, Emma Thompson, and Julie Christie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe narrative is fragmented and episodic for much of the running time, but Cuaron injects so much energy and visual flourish and music to every scene that it’s always enjoyable to watch. Aunt Marge’s [blow-up](https://i.imgur.com/yzKZ78m.png) at the dinner table is turned into a comedic, manic waltz. The [flight on Buckbeak](https://i.imgur.com/rpovOly.png) is a cathartic moment of freedom. The boggart in the wardrobe becomes a big band swing dance. There are some lovely little moments where Harry and his friends are able to relax and [be kids](https://i.imgur.com/mXYszX4.png), but it’s always contrasted with looming menace.  He also adds a few nice moments involving the [Whomping Willow](https://i.imgur.com/OaJi9l5.png) that depict the passing of time, a wonderful touch in a series that is famous for the way it captures the growth of a group of children into adults, with this film as one of the biggest steps along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time-turner sequence in particular is a triumph of suspense and entertainment, as it enables the film to make fun call-backs to earlier scenes in the film, but to also allow Harry to be in [two places at once](https://i.imgur.com/wxHv4XB.png), and for the audience to see it all from his perspective as he experiences it. We do not even know about time travel until we’re experiencing it along with him. There is some excellent sound design in this scene as well; the ticking of a clock can be heard and John Williams incorporates the gong of the clock tower into his series-best score.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final third of the movie delivers consistent excitement and I love the way it incorporates and concludes Harry’s character arc. He begins the movie a teenager, perhaps a bit moodier than before, but also more bold and confident. Throughout the movie, as he begins to learn more about the darkness that has consumed his past, he begins to lose his ability to fly (literally and figuratively). He spends the year with the knowledge that an escaped prisoner is hunting him down and eventually learns that his parent’s death is the result of a betrayal by a close friend. His thoughts turn dark and he begins to seek revenge, even going so far as to be willing to kill. On top of this, Buckbeak is grounded and unfairly sentenced to death, and his beloved Nimbus 2000 broomstick is broken after an encounter with the dementors, the embodiment of past trauma. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe climax sees him learn the truth about the man who betrayed his parents. He reveals his true self by sparing the man responsible for his parent’s deaths and overcomes his greatest fear by using [powerful magic](https://i.imgur.com/4eZvv3U.png) that requires inner strength. He saves his godfather on the back of a newly free Buckbeak and the final shot has him flying away on a new broomstick, giddy with happiness, his demons conquered and a new father figure in his life. He\'s regained his ability to fly by overcoming his greatest fears by learning to trust the strength within himself. It’s not only a great conclusion to this coming of age arc, but it’s also visually cinematic. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think my biggest gripe with the Harry Potter series is that it was made by people who never read the books as children. The reason Prisoner of Azkaban is able to overcome this is because the world is treated with childlike wonder and curiosity by an artist who respects and loves the material and was able to adapt it to their own sensibilities. It’s a serious work by a serious filmmaker and I hope it eventually receives the recognition it deserves.\r\n\r\nPlus, Hermione punches Malfoy, that little shit.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Prisoner of Azkaban is awesome because reasons.\r\n','Call of the Wild',359,160,'2017-09-04 10:56:25'),('6y7w03','Lady Bird | Official Trailer HD | A24','','Greta',1113,230,'2017-09-05 09:15:01'),('6y9x9w','\'Close Encounters\' both proves and exposes Steven Spielberg as a director.','So I think it’s fair to say that Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time. Jaws and Jurrasic Park would vindicate even Michael Bay. Seeing Close Encounters in it’s 45th Anniversary re-release in a AMC Dolby Prime Theater was certainly an experience… that I’d recommend for children.\r\n\r\nSteven has always showcased a childish mind and a confectioner’s tool set that makes it possible to see Captain Hook play baseball, but seldom offers audiences a type of philosophical complexity or intellectually challenging plot, the likes of Chris Nolan. He’s a kids director and it’s never more obvious than in this film.\r\n\r\nUltimately the performances decent from Richard Dreyfus (Jaws) and Francois Truffaut (Nouvelle Vague) and the set pieces are exciting. But the plot is very shallow, and the ideas of faith it puts forth are a bit remedial and redundant. There’s a hollowness at the root of it’s youthful wonder, a void that never gets filled. I found myself checking my phone several times during the Devil’s Tower final sequence, itching to leave. (Could partially blame John Williams for providing a beautiful score that feels too derivative of his other collaborations with Spielberg.)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, sometimes you go out to see a classic film that rests on it’s laurels that it falls flat when examined outside of it’s historical context. Sadly the case here in my opinion.','Wonder Park',0,51,'2017-09-05 14:26:52'),('6yd7bi','My Breakdown of Every Director that Could Conceivably Land the Star Wars: Episode IX Gig. Why/Why not?','Unrealistic literally ZERO chance of happening-\r\n\r\nSteven Spielberg - He’s George Lucas’s best  friend in the business. They made history with Indy together, Spielberg could have never broken amazing ground with “Jurassic Park’s special effects without Lucas’s ILM, and Spielberg assisted with certain scenes of Episode III. Despite his relationship with Kathy Kennedy, zero chance Spielberg would do the gig, even for a crazy offer (Like 20% of the gross of a guaranteed 1.5 billion dollar movie). He would never step in to George’s sandbox and make a well-received movie without George’s involvement, or work for a corporate controlled film that would restrain his creativity. Oh and he’s doing Indy 5 around the same time.\r\n\r\nTarantino, Coppola, Scorsese - They simply don’t do these kinds of movies.\r\n\r\nPatty Jenkins - She’s about to ink the biggest female director deal ever for “Wonder Woman 2” and possibly more DCEU films. No way would Lucasfilm match it.\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson - Doubt it after how poorly “The Hobbit” movies ended up.\r\n\r\nKathryn Bigelow - She’s mainly focused on realistic historical films, doubt she’s be interested in joining a mega-franchise.\r\n\r\nThe Wachowskis - Haven’t made a good movie since 1999.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon - Making Batgirl\r\n\r\nMatt Reeves - Making Batman\r\n\r\nJon Favreau - Making Lion King\r\n\r\nChris Nolan - Would almost certainly not do Star Wars since he’d have to conform to an established storyline/visual style too much.\r\n\r\nFrank Darabont - Won’t Happen\r\n\r\nRobert Zemeckis - Won’t Happen\r\n\r\nRidley Scott - Won’t Happen\r\n\r\nGaereth Edwards - Was replaced on “Rogue One” reshoots.\r\n\r\nDave Filoni - Director of solo live-action Ahsoka Tano film? Odds at 5%. Director of Episode IX? -0%\r\n\r\nGeorge Lucas - No way. Will empty a bottle of anti-freeze into my butthole if he is hired. Tommy Wiseau directing is more likely. \r\n\r\nAlfonso Cuaron - Works at a slow pace. Too creative, Disney would not allow the creative freedom he would demand.\r\n\r\nJoseph Kosinski - You need to make a good movie before you get to make a Star Wars movie.\r\n\r\nGuillermo del Toro and Tim Burton - Both have their own weird and very distinct styles. Would not mesh well with established franchise.\r\n\r\nJames Cameron - Too busy making 98 Avatar sequels and playing with submarines.\r\n\r\nZack Snyder- He sucks.\r\n\r\nM Night Shymalanadingdong - He sucks.\r\n\r\nMichael Bay - He sucks.\r\n\r\nEdgar Wright - No way is he working with the Mouse House after the Ant-Man fiasco.\r\n\r\nJames Gunn - Making a different final film in a space opera trilogy.\r\n\r\nGore Verbinski - The Lone Ranger marks the end of his career.\r\n\r\nBryan Singer - I’m assuming Lucasfilm is aware of the existence of X:Men Apocalypse.\r\n\r\nBrett Ratner - When hell freezes over.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuper long shots but could conceivably get the gig -\r\n\r\nJud Apatow\r\n\r\nAlejandro G.

There was a resurgence of this genre in the mid-90\'s starting with Independence Day which was obviously an amalgamation of disaster movies of the early 70\'s and Star Wars. Like its ancestors from the 1970\'s ID4 kicked off a slew of disaster movies that, still to this day keeps going. Every disaster movie follows the same formula: introduce a diverse cast, scientists discover an impending threat, government or responsible parties are hesitant to respond, shit goes crazy and diverse cast has to work together in the aftermath. \r\n\r\nWhat really makes the formula dull for many of the recent disaster movies is that the huge cast is made of cookie cutter characters that usually have three traits: noble values, no moral flaws and leadership skills or they are skeptical and unhelpful beaurocrats or they are lovable underdogs who save the day.\r\n\r\nThen I think of Earthquake (1974).

Her character decides to go looting in the aftermath of the earthquake.

The national guard character\'s frustration explodes during the movie and he takes revenge on the goons in his apartment building by shooting them and decides to lead his rescue team of other national guardsmen on a raid to extort rescue victims and declare Marshall law. He catches Victoria Principal\'s character looting and arrests her. And I think he attempts to rape her as a response for suppressing feelings of homosexuality and anger towards being bullied that boils to the surface in rage and frustration. Anyway, George Kennedy kills him and saves Victoria Principal and Charleton Heston dies along with Ava Gardner in an attempt to save her from drowning. He tried to save her out of pity and guilt but I believe he still planned to leave her for his mistress in the end, but he doesn\'t make it and goes down with his wife.\r\n\r\nEarthquake is NOT a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it takes a batshit crazy turn by making all the characters a miserable and angry reflection of post-watergate/post-vietnam/post-energy crisis America.\r\n','The Aftermath',1,2,'2017-09-22 13:28:40'),('71snba','John Denver & Chaning Tatum','So John Denver\'s song Take Me Home, Country Roads is HEAVILY featured in Kingsman Secret Circle (which features Chaning Tatum). \r\nBut another movie came out about a month ago called Logan Lucky also featuring Chaning Tatum and also heavily featuring Take Me Home, Country Road. \r\n\r\nI have no idea why.

Nothing wrong with that. My dad did the same with for me with Bad Boys II. What stuck out to me as completely odd about Kingsmen is the complete joke the traditional relationship has become.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT:\r\n\r\nScene 1, with the lovers: We\'re shown Eggsy and the Princess in a happy relationship, getting ready for the next big step- meeting her parents.\r\n\r\nScene 2: Eggsy is at dinner with his girlfriend\'s parents for the first time, while he\'s simultaneously researching the antagonist with another field agent, a smoking hot fox who\'s been vetted to the nines as a sexy-librarian. Once their work is complete, they exchange a few flirty-winky texts, while he is literally staring at his girlfriend between her parents.\r\n\r\nScene 3: THEN in the middle of the film, Eggsy quite literally calls his girlfriend and straight up asks her if he can sleep with this other girl, who\'s working for the antagonist. Now, I understand that the story builds up to this point that he has to do it in order to save the world(i.e. the running joke at the end of the first film) but, as the scene progresses.... she says it would only be fine IF he asked her to marry him, then she would be okay with it...*what?!* \r\n\r\nShe\'s only a little mad and smokes some contaminated weed to cope. But, it\'s okay though he can\'t go through with it. He just fingers the other girl instead...\r\n\r\nFinally, scene 4: at the end of the film...the Kingsmen save the day and Eggsy marries the princess.\r\n\r\nThat\'s it. Those are the only scenes you see their relationship in. It really seemed to encourage infidelity for men, because you\'ll still get the one girl at the end if you try hard enough, while encouraging complacency for women to absorb all heartache for the ring. \r\n\r\nI don\'t consider myself an old-fuddy-duddy just yet. I\'m all for the zany wild adventure a film like this brings but overall, the subplot just struck me as out of place, pushing a narrative that no one, at least in my golden-social circle would adhere to','Call of the Wild',0,2,'2017-09-23 11:55:11'),('71z2ff','Court Rejects Director’s Bid to Take Control of Mel Gibson\'s \'The Professor And The Madman\'','','The Professor and the Madman',88,16,'2017-09-23 11:57:42'),('71z4lw','Judi Dench To Join Kenneth Branagh\'s \'Artemis Fowl\'','','Artemis Fowl',14921,1146,'2017-09-23 12:06:54'),('725snr','What is your ultimate Halloween movie playlist?','I saw someone post something like this yesterday or the day before, but I can\'t seem to find it so I figured I\'d bring it up myself.\r\n\r\nI\'m looking to have a month-long Halloween movie marathon for my friend and I want to introduce her to some new horror/Halloween films while she does the same for me.

In comparison Kingsman: The Secret Service opened at #2 in February of 2015 to $36.2M (weirdly as counter-programming to 50 Shades of Grey instead of vice-versa) so we aren\'t exactly looking at the huge increase we often see with a sequel to a well reviewed film. It\'s also not great that Kingsman: TGC had a lot more runway than the previous film with two weeks out from IT and opening against an underperforming kids film. Now all of this to say that there\'s nothing terribly wrong here. The budget is still about the same, $100M v the $94M of the original. The real question will be the hold as the original had a fantastic multiplier of 3.5x and in that it\'s hard to necessarily see Kingsman: TGC repeating that figure. That sort of multiplier indicates a film that audiences were initially suspicious of but good word of mouth brought them in on second, third, fourth, etc. weekends. I feel like now audiences know what it is and either didn\'t care enough for the sequel or are just burnt out. Still it did receive the same Cinemascore as the original (B+) so if it does multiply to 3.5x or more I will gladly eat my words. The other big factor is overseas where the film is seeing more of that traditional sequel bump. The film grossed $61.2M this weekend overseas, pushing the worldwide gross over $100M in its opening weekend. It saw almost double the premiere of Kingsman: TSS in the UK ($11.1M versus $6.4M) and had great openings in Russia and Taiwan. The real big markets though are yet to come, namely South Korea and China which went big for Kingsman: TSS (China: $74.6M, South Korea: $46.8M). Overall Kingsman: TGC is performing a lot like the golden era of Bond movies it emulates (see Roger Moore era in particular) just trucking along making good solid profits enough to justify the next incarnation hoping that will be the massive hit. \r\n\r\n* Boy the life of the LEGO animated franchise has been fascinating as the third of the franchise opened to an extreme franchise low as **The LEGO Ninjago Movie** opened at #3 with $21.2M. That marks it opening more than $30M less than The LEGO Batman Movie and more than $45M less than The LEGO Movie. While most expected Ninjago to open less than those films it\'s still a markedly low opening for a franchise that\'s just not been fulfilling on the promise of the first film. Speaking of surprise hits The LEGO Movie was a big one, coming in with no expectations to open with $69M and had a fantastic multiplier closing it\'s run at $257.7M. So expectations were very high for LEGO Batman which while a spin-off features one of the most profitable movie heroes ever yet it opened lower than LEGO Movie and had no staying power, closing just under $300M worldwide. In comparison a similarly budgeted movie without the massive branding of LEGO or Batman, The Secret Life of Pets, managed to make 2x as much as LEGO Batman domestically and 2.8x as much worldwide. And now we get to Ninjago which also had franchise lows in every foreign market it opened in. Certainly after LEGO Batman the writing was on the wall because if that film couldn\'t expand it\'s brand then what would happen to a film based on a popular if not universally beloved LEGO TV show that\'s not even a direct continuation of said show? Almost certainly WB will be waiting now with baited breath for what will happen financially with The LEGO Movie Sequel because it\'s not looking good for the LEGO brand, despite good reviews, because the audiences just aren\'t connecting like WB thought they would. \r\n\r\n* It seems the suspiciously named Entertainment Studios (come on that has Yakuza front written all over it) couldn\'t quite recapture the surprising success of 47 Meters Down as their latest direct-to-DVD-quality-but-direct-to-theaters film **Friend Request** opened pitifully at #7 with $2.4M. The film was already release by Warner Bros overseas last year and is already on Region 2 blu-ray, so this screams another direct to DVD film that just was released in hopes of making a big hit. With a $6M budget this isn\'t really a film as much as a minor investment that\'s not paying off. Hopefully ES can recoup with 48 Meters Down...not even kidding, that\'s literally the title. \r\n\r\n* So before I give the record **IT** broke this weekend I will note your opinion on this record will vary greatly on A) what you define as a horror movie and B) how much you care about inflation. Let\'s state the record first and then we\'ll get all nerdy with it. This weekend IT passed the lifetime domestic gross of The Exorcist ($232.9M) earning $266.3M making it the highest grossing R-rated horror film ever. Okay so first up the horror definition. I\'ve seen a lot of articles this week that IT is now the highest grossing horror film period. However while certainly no one doubts The Exorcist as a horror film there is one film that is defined as horror on Box Office Mojo that stands above IT still, The Sixth Sense with a lifetime gross of $293.5M. Now some define this film as a thriller but to me it\'s a horror film and especially one if Box Office Mojo defines it as such, however if you disagree then IT already is the highest grossing horror film overall. Not that it matters much since almost certainly IT will become the first horror film of any qualification to gross over $300M domestic and shatter Sixth Sense\'s record so just wait a week or two if you agree with me. And since Exorcist is rated R and Sixth Sense is PG-13 then there is still a major record here. Okay now on to the inflation stuff which is my personal little pet peeve. Now obviously you are probably thinking, wow $232.9M is a lot of 1970s money, and you\'re mostly right. It\'s crazy impressive that The Exorcist held it\'s record for 40 years and it still stands on the adjusted for inflation chart as the 9th highest grossing film of all time with $983M. Now to start picking nits that number is not totally accurate because actually Exorcist made $193M in its original run but the adjusted and the overall gross account for various re-releases over the years. Part of my problem with adjusted for inflation numbers is most of those films came out long before home video so re-releases were a big damn deal cause it was the only way to see a film for many was a re-release (this is more of a note about Gone with the Wind than The Exorcist who\'s big re-release was in 2000). The other issue is that we use incredibly broad math to define these things, as not only is inflation calculation incredibly broad but a lot of this is based on rough out-molded data long before the days of daily tracking. But even if you trust the math completely I don\'t think it should define your opinion. Look I totally get why seeing adjusted one film making $266M versus another making $983M makes the former look like chump change. Ultimately my main thing is don\'t let inflation calculation take away from either film, both runs are incredibly impressive and important to the industry. The thing is box office defines the kinds of films that will be made and while The Exorcist\'s run is incredible, it doesn\'t define right now outside of bad marketing tropes. IT is going to define the next 5-10 years of horror films, much like Exorcist did for ita day. If you want to bring up inflation in the comments be my guest but just remember all of this stuff is about context. Don\'t let shakey at best math only define what a hit is to you or not because then only the highest of the high notes will even come close to being enough. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

I believe the intention is for the audience to walk away pondering Amy Adams\' choice. I pondered it, and I thought it was incredibly selfish because that kid did not go gently into that good night, she had a shaved head which indicates chemo. I noticed that every argument I came up with against her choice is actually used by pro-lifers. But could I judge Amy Adams? No, because I didn\'t live the experience she did in the movie that led to her choice. (She even calls it a choice at one point.) So I think one subtext of the movie is that it\'s showing the audience what it means to be pro-choice on an intellectual level, just using the other side of choice instead of abortion to illustrate it. By being detached it somehow leaves empathy up to the audience instead of manipulating us. Very clever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENEMY - I don\'t think it sucks, I just hate it. Nothing much happens for an hour and what does is deliberately confusing. The score is so oppressively tension-filled I lost patience, stopped the movie halfway through and went to read up on it. Unfortunately this movie is from a man (Villenueve said it\'s about his inner thoughts at the time,) about man problems, and interpreted by men to be such. Very little left for a women\'s perspective. Which would be fine, except the common interpretation is that wife + child = totalitarianism. \'Scuse me but I felt for the wife because she\'s saddled with a pregnancy and a gigantic manbaby who goes mental because he can\'t handle commitment. ffs, really. BUT, there could be more to it. The recurring totalitarianism theme could be political, as Villenueve is French-canadian and the movie is set in Canada. The book it\'s based on is political from a Venezuelan. I know nothing about French-canadian politics and American politics are hard enough to follow at the moment, so maybe it just went above my and other Americans\' heads. If you like abstract puzzle movies with interesting premises you might like this, I dunno, I still hate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRISONERS - there is a crapton of stuff going on in this movie, perhaps missed because it\'s easy to figure out the main antagonist early on. It\'s all about the moral grey areas, the irony, we get that. Most people recognize the catholic and norse mythology symbolism present, I mean the characters\' names couldn\'t be more spot on if they tried. But I think there is more to it. It\'s got character studies on HOW religions impact their actions. Jackman and Gyllenhaal especially. But everyone seems to miss the greek myth symbolism, I don\'t know why. Terence Howard represents empathy, Viola Davis represents perhaps reason but definitely lawful neutral. The police chief is doubt. The main antagonist is the Minotaur. (I suppose this would make Joy, the little girl who escaped, Theseus.)  The shopgirl is an oracle. Maria Bello is Eurydice, back from the dead when her daughter is rescued. And I suspect the movie itself is set up in part like a greek tragedy - it is almost 3 hours long so there is room for it - but I haven\'t refreshed myself on greek tragedy structure yet. One thing I read that wouldn\'t have occurred to me is that Loki\'s trickery would actually make for a successful detective, and the movie explains this by having him raised in a boys home, where the opportunity to become the criminals he\'s chasing was present. Also he transforms into Odin during his biggest heroic gesture. Is this in norse mythology? I don\'t know. Det. Loki also has masonic symbols tattooed on his fingers, not sure what that means but it\'s more food for thought. Interesting that the catholic characters duke it out as (maybe fallen, maybe not) angels and demons though; that\'s so catholic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think together all three movies explore toxic masculinity from different perspectives: the woman\'s, the man\'s, and religions\'.  For instance Jackman in Prisoners is under a heavy burden he himself created with his relationship dynamic to his family.  His wife is completely dependent on him to the point of non-functioning, his teenage son can\'t disagree, only rebel.  Terence Howard and Viola Davis had more of a partnership.  But Jackman\'s dynamic and that amount of responsibility that toxic masculinity requires is what Gyllenhaal was afraid of in Enemy.  Amy Adams makes her own choice regardless of toxic masculinity, and Jeremy Renner ends up leaving her because he thinks it was the wrong choice, but was it a bad choice?  The audience is given autonomy to form there own opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClever stuff.\r\n\r\n','Angel Has Fallen',0,3,'2017-09-29 17:26:50'),('73gulr','I know who the Thing is in the 1982 classic THE THING, finally solving the mystery ending. [spoilers, of course]','Okay, so *maybe* I don\'t 100% know who the Thing is at the end, but I\'m 100% convinced it\'s MacReady & here\'s why...\r\n\r\nYesterday, I decided to watch [The Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/?ref_=nv_sr_1), having not seen it in years & never knowing who-was-who during the final scene. Before the end, I was absolutely sure it was Kurt Russel\'s character MacReady, having felt the film delivered all the necessary clues. So, let\'s start with the opening sequence:\r\n\r\n- The first person the dog comes into contact with is George Bennings (Peter Maloney), licking him before being shot at. The shot strikes Bennings in the leg & MacReady gives him his bottle of alcohol shortly after. Bennings sips from it before the shot cuts, showing contact. Considering MacReady is a drinker, he’s bound to drink from that bottle again. Maybe this isn’t a big deal, but later in the film, Fuchs (Joel Polis) suggests everyone only eat from cans & prepare their own meals, preventing any contact with the Thing.\r\n\r\n- Skip ahead to everyone deciding who’s in charge, when Childs (Keith David) says he’ll do it. MacReady responds with “Maybe somebody a little more even-tempered, Childs.” No one disagrees, suggesting MacReady is the more even-tempered of the two. I’ll come back to why I believe this to be a clue.\r\n\r\n- After Fuchs makes his suggestion about food preparation, he’s startled by something in the hallway. He chases it outside & finds a shirt with *R. L. MacReady* printed on it. Once Fuchs’ body is discovered, MacReady & Nauls (T.K. Carter) go up to MacReady’s cabin. Cut to Childs stating they’ve been gone nearly an hour when Nauls comes back, covered in ice. He claims he ditched MacReady & that “he’s one of ‘em!” The door handle starts to turn, but slowly & in a fashion you’d expect from someone (or something) trying to figure it out. Like watching the velociraptors trying to open the doors in Jurassic Park. Childs then nervously shouts, “Nothing human could have made it back here, through this weather, without a guide line!”\r\n\r\n- MacReady’s not the same once he comes back from the storm; he’s a lot less even-tempered. During his first encounter with the Thing, he yells at Child’s for hesitating to burn it with the flamethrower. When the Thing shows itself on the operating table, transforming Norris (Charles Hallahan)’s body, MacReady doesn’t do anything. He waits until everyone is gone & then burns some of the Thing. Norris’ head separates from the rest of the body, which MacReady allows to crawl away, only burning the rest of the body after. When the other guys see the spider-head-thing, MacReady has no other choice but to burn it, otherwise exposing himself to the crew.\r\n\r\n- In the beginning, the Thing replicated the dog perfectly, even convincing the other dogs it was a dog. It’s stated in the movie that the thing needs to be alone with said subject to replicate. So, attacking while in plain sight is too risky. MacReady, being a perfect replica, must pretend to be one of them, never exposing himself & only allowing other replicas to be caught, just as long as he isn’t. Hence, why he allowed the spider-thing to get away, but had to kill it once the guys saw it. Besides, Fuchs earlier explains to MacReady that the burnt bodies still had cellular activity. During the infamous blood test scene, MacReady makes a big deal about the cells trying to defend themselves. The problem is, MacReady’s the one in charge holding the flamethrower & hot copper wire. **He even administers his own blood test.** If he’s the Thing, it’s essentially attacking itself, so it would know not to react violently like Palmer (David Clennon)’s did. After Palmer transforms, (once again) MacReady hesitates to use his flamethrower. This time, he acts as though it’s failing, yet it clearly still has a flame. **Only after infecting Windows** (Thomas Waites) does MacReady decide to burn Palmer\'s infected body, when his flamethrower *suddenly* functions again.\r\n\r\n- So, why do they decide to destroy everything at the end? Because MacReady decided to… If he’s the Thing, his only goal is to survive & get off Antarctica. So, he destroys the facility, preventing any long-term survival of the crew. No way in hell were they going to survive the storm without a proper enclosure, which was conveniently blown up! The Thing survived thousands of years frozen in ice; it could handle a few months until a rescue crew arrived. So, what about MacReady yelling Fuck you, too! If he’s trying to convince humans he’s real, expressing that anger out loud would convince someone he’s real. He had no idea where Childs was, nor whether Childs could have been close by listening. This, of course, is just speculation on my part.\r\n\r\n- The final scene in the snow - Childs is the only one with a flamethrower & MacReady is unarmed. They’re the only two left. And MacReady must play his part as to not be burned to death by Childs, the only surviving human. Instead of risk death & attack Childs, MacReady suggests they stay there for awhile, “see what happens.” Given enough time, Childs will either die from the cold or simply fall asleep from exhaustion. Either way, the Thing will have success, as all it needs to do is get off the island. As Blair (Wilford Brimley) said during his rampage, the Thing didn’t want to be a dog, it wanted to be one of us. So, it could get off the continent. Some people theorize that MacReady tested Childs in the end, giving him gasoline to drink, proving Childs is the Thing. But I argue that that test could go both ways. If MacReady was an alien, it too could serve Childs, not knowing what gasoline is. Also, if contact from sharing the same drink leads to infection like Fuchs warned about, MacReady could have infected Childs intentionally. Hence... let\'s wait awhile, as MacReady suggests.\r\n\r\n- I think the ending & who’s who is not just about which character is the Thing, but the status of the actors in the real world at that time. 1982, movies were a little different. Black actors were rarely leads, and most of the time were the first to die off in a movie. This is also a time when the lead actor would never die in a movie. It was almost unheard of back then. This film gives an opportunity for Keith David (Childs) to be the hero, which he arguably was during a lot of the movie, while Kurt Russell gets killed off without us ever knowing when or him ever losing much screen time.\r\n\r\n- As a final thought, this is just my interpretation, and I’m probably wrong. It’s probably Childs, and the clues I’ve gathered are just my imagination. Or who knows, maybe Childs & MacReady might both be human, and they’re both waiting for their inevitable deaths.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** MacReady is the Thing, though I’m probably full’a shit\r\n','Crawl',206,133,'2017-09-30 15:13:45'),('73if09','What is your favourite feel good/hustler movie?','I\'m finally starting my first job soon, but I\'m super worried about messing everything up, failing, and not being able to adapt after spending so long out of doing anything productive.

I created an edit that brings the remake more in line with the tone of the original. The family aspect is gone, Michael never speaks as a child, and the gore and some of the awful dialogue is toned down. \r\n\r\nHalloween Resurrection (The Make Michael Scary Again edit)\r\nNo more kung fu, no more characters talking trash to Michael when they should be fighting for their lives.

I hadn\'t seen any of these, so I was pretty excited to see what was so special about Chucky. Here are my thoughts! \r\n\r\n#Child’s Play\r\n\r\nThere is some very snappy dialogue in this. Andy is kind of whiney, but honestly, so was I at that age, so I guess it’s just good acting. Chucky himself is fun as well, with Brad Dourif seeming to delight in his evil. He’s good at that *cough Grima Wormtongue cough*. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of little things I like about this movie. They constantly hint that Chucky is indeed alive, but you don’t see him break character until 45 minutes in, and when he does, it’s hilarious. They also explain why Chucky knew the spell, when I fully when expected it to just be a “plot driving thing he knows ^TM”. There’s also some fun kills like the voodoo doll kill, but to me, the scariest part of these movies is always the dismissal by authority figures. Nobody believes anyone, and I can’t imagine how awful that is. \r\n\r\nThis is a good movie! \r\n\r\n#Child’s Play 2\r\n\r\n*This* is how you bring back a bad guy. It’s a goofy resurrection, but *Child’s Play 2* gets away with it because it was *sufficiently* goofy. \r\n\r\nWhile not everyone returns (“she’s undergoing psychiatric evaluation” seemed to be a pretty obvious way of saying “We didn’t want to pay for Andy’s mom to come back”), there’s some fun new characters like Andy’s foster sister Kyle and Andy’s teacher who essentially drops a “snitches get stiches” on him. \r\n\r\nChild’s Play 2 isn’t short on intensity though. They smartly trade in established goodwill from the first movie to keep us on edge from the beginning. We know Chucky is alive, and we’re waiting for him to talk. We don’t need another 45-minute wait to see if Andy is nuts.\r\n\r\n Don Mancini hits you with spooky scenes like a suffocation that goes on for a long time, a tense basement search, and more. There’s also fun kills, with my personal favorite being the photocopier. Chucky is a funny guy, with plenty of one-liners, and at one point he rips off his own hand and replaces it with a knife, so that’s neat. \r\n\r\nI didn’t have anywhere else to put this, but there’s also a better melting scene than Jason Takes Manhattan, and there’s an exploding head that reminds me of Robocop acid guy. \r\n\r\nThis is excellent, but only if you’ve seen the original. Not really a franchise you can just “jump in anywhere”. \r\n\r\n\r\n#Child’s Play 3\r\n\r\nI love a good opening credits scene, and *Child’s Play 3* delivers, with Chucky getting melted down and then reforged in plastic. \r\n\r\nThe acting is again quite good, with top honors going to Perrey Reeves who played Kristen De Silva, and Travis Fine, who REALLY sinks his teeth into the “shithead drill sergeant” role of Lt. Colonel Brett Shelton.\r\n \r\nChucky really revels in his movie monster-ness by Child’s Play 3, and he seems very aware of how crazy this all is. That said, I do like that Chucky’s reasoning for why he can stop trying to possess Andy makes sense. The benefit of a consistent writer! \r\n\r\nChucky gets more cool kills, like the dumpster kill and even the CEO at the beginning, but I actually laughed out loud at the Colonel stealing his kill by having a heart attack. Chucky also sets up a handful of very tense scenes by tampering with paintball rifles, and there’s also plenty of cool effects, particularly on Chucky himself, which have become fairly par-for-the-course in this series now. \r\n\r\nThe fair/house of horror at the end deserves rebuke for several unsafe practices though. Tsk tsk. \r\n\r\n\r\n#Bride of Chucky\r\n\r\nNeat homage to all the other movie killers with a bunch of iconography at the beginning… Jason and Michael’s masks, and Freddy’s glove. There’s also a pinhead reference later on, and maybe even more that I missed. Add in a good theme song by Rob Zombie means a this is yet another solid opening for this franchise. \r\n\r\nJennifer Tilly is introduced to the series (reading Voodoo for dummies, which didn’t quite get a laugh, but it did get a nose exhalation) in this movie as Tiffany, and she is GREAT. Sexy, but very creepy. Kind of a black widow vibe. She also has delightful banter with Chucky, a weird doll sex scene years before Team America, and overall just brings her doll to life. Pun intended. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast falls between acceptable and good. Katherine Heigl is in this, and she’s not bad, just kind of… meh. John Ritter is pretty good playing against type, and of course, Brad Dourif is doing his thing. \r\nOverall, it’s a pretty decent ensemble who bring together a very funny script, and there’s a few good kills in there too (especially the honeymoon kill). It’s not scary, but it’s a good movie. \r\n\r\n#Seed of Chucky\r\n\r\nThe first movie to miss the mark with the opening credits, where we follow some doll sperm. There’s a nice Psycho homage in the opening dream, but it’s not quite enough to redeem it. \r\n\r\nThere’s more Jennifer Tilly being funny, John Waters, weirdly detailed doll boobs… but not a lot of fun kills, which is what we came for. \r\n\r\nI don’t want to give the impression I didn’t like this movie. I did. Redman is hilarious, “It’s a voodoo pregnancy, it’s accelerated” is a funny way of saying “don’t think too hard about how this works”, and it’s very progressive. But I just didn’t really connect with Glen(da). This doll is voiced by a fool of a Took, but they’re very passive, and I just never was particularly interested. \r\n\r\nCouple things I DO want to give a shout out to are Jennifer Tilly’s driver having a full character arc with like… 10 lines, a great subversion of the Shining reference, and weirdly effective gore when it came to the dolls. Particularly that guy opening Tiff’s back and Glen(da) cutting up Chucky. \r\n\r\nOverall this is the weakest, but it’s still worth watching. \r\n\r\n#Curse of Chucky\r\n\r\nWe’re back to actual horror movies instead of horror comedy, which I can appreciate. I was delighted to see after lacking a bunch of cool kills in *Seed*, *Curse* has them in spades. There’s a great spinning shot of a dinner table where one dish is poisoned, someone gets their jaw knocked off, and more. Worse than those though is WASPy Barb’s fear that she “might have to send (her daughter) to public school”. \r\n\r\nThe character of Barb is such a bitch in this and I love it. This is the right kind of “asshole” character, where you still kind of like them, unlike the antagonist girl in *F13 VII* and Trent or Chad or Devin or whatever his name was in the F13 reboot. But I digress.\r\n \r\nI have to say though, something seemed off about Chucky’s design to me. I don’t know if it’s new animatronics, or just the budget showing, or what, but it just didn’t look quite as good as usual to me. That said, his return to an unblemished face leads to a cool scene later, so that works. \r\n\r\nThe budget also appears when they hilariously use an “internet search” brand search engine. It’s 2004, you couldn’t spring for at least askjeeves? \r\n\r\nBudget can’t affect that writing though. Everything in this movie sets something up later or moves story/characters forward. Don is also at it again with great trope subversions, in particular the “dad is lusting after the nanny” cliché. The quality difference between some of the later, direct-to-video *Hellraiser*s and this was remarkable. Here I am, remarking on it.\r\n\r\nConversely for writing, I didn’t love the flashback about Nica’s mom… honestly, this movie could have worked as just “hey, Chucky is insane and now he’s killing these people”. I guess it works to keep the universe small, and I don’t begrudge people who DO like it, but not everything needs to be connected in my opinion. \r\nThere’s also a neat stinger after the credits. Won’t spoil it, but worth sticking around for. \r\n\r\n#Cult of Chucky\r\n\r\nPoor Andy. Google would *really* fuck up his dating. Guess the relationship with De Silva from 3 didn’t work out?  I am glad however that they kept Nica even as they brought back in Andy, and they put the movie in an interesting setting.\r\n\r\n*Cult of Chucky* definitely kept me gripped; There’s a lot of cool imagery, like “not so fast” written in blood, a neat glass falling death that seemed to be an homage to the previously mentioned honeymoon kill in *Bride*, and an arm shoved through someone’s face. \r\n\r\nWhile it is definitely still more horror than comedy, flashes of that comedy do shine through… especially when they ask “Mrs. Valentine” if anyone has ever told her she looks just like Jennifer Tilly. \r\n\r\nAs far as acting, I thought it was very solid. Special props go to Michael Therriault who does a great job playing the kindly therapist, only to uh… betray that role later on.\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to be sure I mention is my appreciation for their commitment to the violence. I’m so used to the MPAA censoring the kills in movies like F13 that when they show a death in this, I kept expecting them to cut away. Nope. You see every gory detail of that kicked in face, or the glass slicing someone’s neck, etc. This is an adult’s movie, and we’re adults, so let us see what we signed up to see damn it!  \r\n\r\nThis movie does so much right. I like the kills, and I like Andy, and I like Nica, but unfortunately the one thing I don’t really like… is the idea.  Several versions of Chucky/him spreading takes away from the specialness in my opinion. This knocked it down a bit for me, but I did like the bleak ending, and I’m definitely looking forward to the next one. \r\n \r\n\r\n#FINAL ORDER: 2, 1, Bride (on Jennifer Tilly’s back), Cult, 3, Curse, Seed…\r\n\r\nbut they’re honestly all relatively similar levels of quality and I enjoyed them all. \r\n\r\nDon Mancini is clearly the lynchpin of this franchise, and without him guiding with his writing/sometimes directing, I can see this easily becoming awful schlock. As is, there’s an awesome consistency to it that I greatly respect. Also, I think I might be in love with Jennifer Tilly, so feel free to hit me up, Jen. \r\n\r\nI I can get in one more franchise before Halloween, so if you want to see another Horror Series review, make sure you leave a suggestion.

But after posting it, I wasn\'t sure if I wanted to do anymore or if it was working. But today I\'ve decided to revive it with a few changes. I\'ll just give my thoughts on some of the the movie news this week, no tv reviews no reviews (Those are separate posts).\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, here we go.\r\n\r\nFirst Trailer Released For The Phantom Thread- Back in June, all of us film fans were saddened to hear that Daniel Day Lewis would be retiring from acting after he finished Phantom Thread (I don\'t know if I 100% believe that, but that\'s another story). Yesterday, the first trailer dropped. And I didn\'t love it. I\'m not saying it looks bad, but it didn\'t move me the way I wanted it too. I don\'t have an answer as to why that\'s the case, but it just is. Still, it looks like decent slow paced love story with an amazing performance from DDL and excellent set and costume designs. I can\'t wait to see this film, but I feel like the first trailer should\'ve been better.\r\n\r\nBox Office Results- Coming in first place was Boo 2 directed by Tyler Perry. These Madea films aren\'t going away any time soon unfortunately. I actually think Perry has some talent as an actor (Watch him in Gone Girl), but I wish he\'d stop with these Madea holiday films. But the 2 bombs this weekend were Geostorm (Coming in second place) and The Snowman (Coming in eighth place). Geostorm bombing wasn\'t really a surprise considering how incredibly dumb the plot sounds and how terrible the reviews were. I can\'t imagine that Dean Devlin will be directed another big budget film any time soon. The Snowman flopping critically and commercially bums me out since I\'m a big Michael Fassbender fan and the premise sounded great. But according to the reviews, it seems to be a boring unfinished mess. I don\'t think this will really effect Fassbender\'s career though since he wasn\'t involved with the film creatively and that most of us know how great of an actor he is. Plus, X-Men Dark Phoenix comes out next November. Good news if he wants a surefire hit.\r\n\r\nEarly Thor Ragnarok Reviews- Last Thursday, the review embargo for Thor Ragnarok lifted and the reviews have been bloody spectacular. It currently has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and most reviewers seem to agree that it\'s the best film in the Thor series. I\'m very excited for the film and these reviews do increase my excitement, but I\'ll admit I\'m a little cautious because the last 2 MCU films (Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 and Spider-Man Homecoming) disappointed me. Also, it will be hard to beat the firs Thor movie for me. I love that film and think it\'s one of Marvel\'s best. If it is better, just wow.\r\n\r\nMichael Bay Producing A Dora The Explorer Movie?- This is the strangest movie news story I\'ve heard all year. When I first saw this, I thought it was fake until I realized The Hollywood Reporter was running with it. Why is this happening? I can understand the appeal of an animated Dora movie for kids, but a live action movie about a teenage Dora produced by Michael Bay? I think I know what I\'m in for and it doesn\'t sound good.\r\n\r\nVenom Begins Production- Finally. Sony\'s Venom film started filming yesterday. The film is now a reality and my wish is coming true. I expect we\'ll see some big behind the scenes pics and more casting info (Carnage) very soon. It was also confirmed by Andy Serkis that Tom Hardy will be playing Venom through motion capture. Smart move. You can\'t do Venom right with a practical costume.\r\n\r\nPacific Rim/Godzilla/King Kong Crossover?- Pacific Rim 2 director Steven Deknight recently said that there have been some discussions about incorporating Pacific Rim into the Godzilla/Kong universe. In theory, that sounds awesome. Imagine Gypsy Danger fighting both Kong and Godzilla. But when you really think about it, it might not be the best idea since Pacific Rim has a very different tone than the Monsterverse films so far.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the recent news?

It may be one of the most intense, emotional movies I\'ve seen. All I knew about it before watching was that it had been nominated for best foreign film at the Oscars the year it came out, and what I read on the back of the Blu-Ray. And it blew my expectations out of the water in every sense.\r\n\r\nThe revelations during the film hit you like a ton of bricks and I felt like I\'d been punched in the gut during the last 10 minutes; I dunno where I thought the story was going, but I definitely had no inkling of the emotional response I\'d have to where it ended up. I\'m definitely not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn\'t seen it, so all I can say is if you loved Villeneuve\'s other films, I think you will love this one too.\r\n\r\nIt\'s definitely not a \'fun\' film that I will watch very many times, and you may need a box of tissues, but it has to be one of the best films I\'ve seen in a long time. What does r/movies think of \'Incendies\' as compared to the rest of Villeneuve\'s movies? And can we please get this man an Oscar? I can\'t wait to see what he does next.','The Best of Enemies',51,31,'2017-10-25 19:12:01'),('791iaj','With Justice League coming out in less than a month let\'s not forget about what started it all, Man of Steel and what lead us to this point.','I may or may not be in the minority here, not sure since I haven\'t seen people talk about it in a while, but I really loved this movie.\r\n\r\nMan of Steel came out in 2013 as WB\'s response to Marvel and all their success but at the time it wasn\'t clear whether or not it would be part of a larger universe. The fact that many people went wild when glimpses of a Wayne Enterprises logo appeared in a few scenes shows just how hungry we were for Batman and Superman to share the screen. \r\n\r\nThis film came out only a year after The Dark Knight Rises and was also written with the help of Christopher Nolan so many people were very excited yet Skeptical over the possibility of Christian Bale\'s Batman existing within this universe. Nolan made such a groundbreaking yet unique franchise that might have felt tarnished once this grounded universe was introduced to a character like Superman.\r\n\r\nHowever aside from all of that, this movie was an insane and powerful origin story to a character many people had already known almost everything about. Whether it be the amazing visuals or the epic fights between Zod and Supes, this film truly went for it and I dug it.\r\n\r\nFast forward to SD Comic Con 2013 and WB announces the highly anticipated Batman v Superman. Before Dawn of Justice was added, this film garnered insane amounts of hype. I remember it was announced at the same time of Age of Ultron and when anyone can overshadow news like that, you know you got something special... Unfortunately Warner Bros realized this and decided to cram in as much into this film as they deemed possible. This of course lead to the setup film no one wanted or needed with the end result being two full movies crammed into 2 hours and 30 minutes. Needless to say fans were lukewarm at best upon release. It showed with the final box office numbers reaching just shy of $900 million with 2 of the most recognizable characters in American culture.\r\n\r\nNext on the list came Suicide Squad. When the trailer was released at SDCC 2015 it looked incredible. DC looked like they were about to have 2 great film coming out within the next year. Although people weren\'t too keen on Jared Leto\'s Joker, they still thought it could be great. However, fast forward a year and the final result was, much like the tattoo on Joker\'s forehead, damaged. The final cut was edited by some music video company separate from the initial production and the varying tones of the film made that very apparent. Nonetheless the film managed to earn more than $700 mil at the box office and sparked countless reports of character spinoffs.\r\n\r\nMost recently we were gifted the much needed surprise of Wonder Woman. This film\'s production was terrorized by speculation and rumors. Not many people had faith in this project as it came off the backdrop of 2 not so well received attempts by Warner Bros to expand the DC brand as far as it can go. A rumor even came out midway through production claiming it to be a mess. This couldn\'t have been further from the truth however as Wonder Woman shocked the nation as what many people claim to be DC\'s best film yet. It wasn\'t with flaws obviously but it was what fans were looking for and was generally seen as a success taking up more than $800 mil at the box office.\r\n\r\nWith Justice League just around the corner I have to say I\'m a little worried for what we will see. The trailer (to me) look kind of bland and uninspired. It seems pretty safe considering it follows something like Man of Steel which I feel took a few needed risks and felt truly bold. It\'s clear Warner Bros is aiming for safe not groundbreaking. Obviously I want it to be great and will be the first person to admit I was wrong but as of now we will see...\r\n\r\nThe future looks pretty bright for DC and Warner Bros. It seems that they are steering away from a shared universe and focusing more on self contained stories so a lot less of what we saw with BVS. James Wan is in charge of Aquaman which will at the very least be unique. The dude that did Lego Batman is working on a Nightwing film. There\'s like 20 Joker movies in the works.

However, after watching Halloween (1978) again I\'ve learned that he has no regard for traffic laws and occasionally puts himself in positions where he has to run around station wagons.','Back in May, I broke down the data on [Michael Myer’s Illinois to California road trip in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6bicq9/after_researching_various_maps_1971_buick_skylark/) The trip had always fascinated me and I wanted to know how many times he had to refuel and use his turn signal. The idea of an evil murderer using his blinkers made me laugh and it lead to surmising that he used his blinker 57 times due to the route on Google maps. However, after rewatching the original Halloween (1978) I came across a startling discovery. The dude never uses his turn signal (cue semi-dramatic music) and puts in a lot of work to scare Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).\r\n\r\nI know this is a stupid thing to harp on but if you’ve read my posts you know that I love tracking the deadly journeys that horror film characters embark on. I enjoy filling in the blanks and figuring out the intricacies of trips and giving the world something stupid to talk about. I had never considered covering Halloween (1978) before because director John Carpenter and writer/producer Debra Hill admitted that they were “kids” while working on the shoot and many of their one-off decisions (killing promiscuous people) have been given way too much thought. There is something pure about Halloween and that pureness was simply to scare audiences, keep them uneasy and have Michael Myers pop up everywhere at any moment.\r\n\r\nWhat I love most about Halloween is how in Carpenter’s quest to make the audience “uneasy” he had Michael appear pretty much everywhere which meant he did a lot of walking, running, and hiding behind shrubs. The following post breaks down the various sightings and tracks his movements in three heading scratching scenes. This post is totally unnecessary but hopefully, it gives you a clearer idea into the movements of a famous fictional killer.\r\n\r\nBefore I get to the three scenes here is a very loose breakdown of Michael Myers movements throughout the film.\r\n\r\n1. Steals a car\r\n2. Kills a guy and steals his clothes\r\n3. Arrives in Haddonfield\r\n4. Finds childhood home\r\n5. Pulls a large gravestone out of the ground\r\n6. Robs a hardware store\r\n7. Eats a dog? --  It\'s up for debate when he ate the dog.*\r\n8. Spooks Laurie at school\r\n9. Harasses a kid\r\n10. Follows Laurie home\r\n11. Drives around for like two hours\r\n12. Hunts between the two houses and kills another dog….\r\n13. Cuts two holes in a sheet and kills a lady.\r\n14. Dies?\r\n\r\nHere are the three instances where he appears to Laurie then has to make a quick getaway.\r\n\r\n**1. Moment: Laurie sees Michael staring at her.**\r\n\r\n**Where**: Laurie is in a classroom. Michael is standing across the street on the driver’s side of his vehicle.\r\n\r\n**When:** 15:40 – 16:15\r\n\r\n**How much time did he need to get away?** 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n**How did he do it?** I tested this out in my driveway and there is no way he could’ve simply walked around the car and drove away. Michael literally had to run around the car, open the door, start the car and drive away. It is unclear whether the car was on or not. This doesn’t affect the fact that an evil shape had to run around the car to drive away.\r\n\r\n**Random Thoughts:** There are a lot of variables to this scene. The only thing that never changes is that Michael had to run around the car. How did Michael find her? What happens if Laurie looks back to the street faster? How did he time it so perfectly? We do know that she actually saw Michael and it wasn’t a vision (confirmed on 35th anniversary Blu-ray commentary by Carpenter). In those 15 seconds, he had to do more than saunter which I think is pretty awesome.\r\n\r\n**2. Moment: Laurie sees Michael standing next to some hedges.**\r\n[Here is the Youtube clip for 2 & 3 in this list] (https://youtu.be/jXrhObXq42o)\r\n\r\n**Where:** She is walking home from school. Michael is chilling.\r\n\r\n**When:** 23:41\r\n\r\n**How much time did he need to get away?:** 26 seconds\r\n\r\n**How did he get away?:** He walked around the back of the house and stopped when he got to the clothesline behind Laurie’s house. It’s doable. \r\n\r\n**Random Thoughts:** This moment takes place after Michael slams on the station wagon brakes when yells “Speed kills!” at him. So, he parked the station wagon on the street, ran 200 feet to some hedges (counted their steps) and waited till they came up the sidewalk. I love that Michael must’ve been peering through a crack in the hedges until it was safe to step out. Having Michael play peekaboo with Laurie adds another dimension to the character. He starts to come across as a cheeky/evil fellow who enjoys messing with babysitters. \r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Moment: Laurie sees Michael hanging around some clotheslines**.\r\n\r\n**Where:** Laurie is at her house. Michael is hanging out by a clothesline.\r\n\r\n**When:** 26:36\r\n\r\n**How much time did he need to get away?:** Zero seconds because Laurie is looking at him the entire time.\r\n\r\n**How did he get away:** I’m assuming he waited for a perfect wind to push the sheets up so he could walk into a wooded area.\r\n\r\n**Random Thoughts:** This is the toughest appearance to break down because it happens so quick. I am assuming it happened (per Carpenter) so I’m taking the escape at face value. Logic suggests that Michael sidestepped into the surrounding foliage. However, I’d like to think that he did a quick somersault and propelled himself into the wooded area. That would be awesome!\r\n\r\nThere you have it! Michael Myers covered a lot of ground and potentially did a somersault to escape Laurie’s view.

I\'ve never read the books, but this film always interested me. I meant to see it in theaters, but do to other commitments I missed it. I\'ve heard a lot of bad things about the film and it\'s production and my expectations were lowered. And that might\'ve been a good thing.\r\n\r\nI actually kind of enjoyed it. It\'s not flawless and it has some big problems, but overall, I was glad that I watched it and wouldn\'t mind getting the Blu Ray.\r\n\r\nLet\'s talk about the good stuff about Dark Tower. First of all, the kid who plays Jake, Tom Taylor, was great. The whole movie hinges on his performance. Jake is a very troubled kid and Taylor sold it. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the acting, Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are great as The Gunslinger and The Man In Black. Yes, The MIB in this film is kind of over the top and corny (Although I\'ve heard that the character is kind of like that in the books), but I was entertained by it and you could tell McConaughey was having fun playing this super evil character. As far as Elba\'s performance goes, great. The Gunslinger is also a very broken character. He\'s the last of his kind wanting revenge on The Man In Black. And Elba brought his A game to that (And to some of the fish out of water comedy scenes). He\'s also a total badass with some really cool gunslinging action.\r\n\r\nThe world (Or Worlds) they set up was great. Very rich and creative with a lot of franchise potential. I just wish we saw more of it on screen.\r\n\r\nMost of the action is very good as well (Even though most of the best moments were already shown in the trailer). It\'s not mind blowing or anything (Except for The Gunslingers kills), but still very fine.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a nice father and son bond that forms between The Gunslinger and Jake that I found very touching and believable. Taylor and Elba have really good chemistry in this film.\r\n\r\nJunkie XL\'s score was also really well done. I\'ll be adding that to my Spotify account.\r\n\r\nAll of that being said though, this movie still has some big issues.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this film is actually how short it is. The film is only 95 minutes long (With credits) and because of that the film moves very fast and you don\'t get to really go in depth about Mid World, the skin monsters, more about the Sayre character, the magic balls The MIB has, how The Gunslinger is immune to the MIB\'s magic, what\'s The Crimson King, where did the Tower come from, etc. I know there\'s like an hour of footage that got cut and I would love to see an extended cut to see if it fleshes things out more.\r\n\r\nThe film also relies a lot on exposition dialogue. Exposition dialogue isn\'t always a bad thing, but when films over use it it can feel kind of lazy. I get that this type of film probably needs some exposition, but I wished they showed more than they told.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the film can feel kind of choppy (Part of that may be because of what happened between the director and Sony). It\'s not Suicide Squad level messy, but you can tell that this film when through extensive reshoots and had a lot of scenes removed. Some scene transitions feel very off, like there was supposed to be another scene in between them or the previous scene was supposed to be longer.\r\n\r\nAlso, while I liked aspects of the ending, it felt very rushed. It didn\'t feel like the film was ready to end yet. And the way they defeat the MIB is very quick and disappointing. They kind of wasted him.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Dark Tower isn\'t a great movie and it has problems with some of it\'s pacing, structure, and length, but I found it to be an entertaining action fantasy film with great lead performances and an interesting world/lore. I don\'t think it deserves a 15% on RT. It\'s not a disaster like The Last Airbender, Dragonball Evolution, or Mortal Kombat Annihilation. I would like to see more of this world adapted. I know a sequel is unlikely, but I hope the planned TV show happens.\r\n\r\nI give The Dark Tower a surprising 3.5/5\r\n\r\nWhat did you think of the film? Did you love it? Did you hate it? How different is this movie from the books. Comment and let me know.

The purpose of the rewrite was to make the film “less serious” and “more hopeful” than it’s dour predecessor Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After the movie finished shooting in October 2016 and Snyder delivered his first cut, the studio felt Snyder had improved the tone but more work was needed to lighten it up and bring it in at under two hours. Joss Whedon (already at work on Batgirl for the studio) was brought aboard to do the rewrites, and eventually directed the expensive reshoots after Snyder’s daughter passed away. Said reshoots helped balloon the budget to the $300 million range, and word from those who have seen the film suggests it is very easy to spot the dialogue-heavy Whedon scenes amid Snyder’s amped-up action.\r\n\r\n>“A lot of the work was integrating the two tones and making it feel like one movie,” said an anonymous production source.\r\n\r\n>Although early screenings were not successful, the newly-polished Justice League has reportedly earned test scores in the same ball park as Wonder Woman, with Ezra Miller’s Flash being heralded as the breakout character. Warners originally saw Justice League as their most important tentpole of the year, but after the surprise success of both Wonder Woman and the horror film IT, the studio no longer needs Justice League to overachieve as hard. It is expected to open north of $100 million, though.\r\n\r\n>**The article also notes that aside from James Wan’s recently-wrapped Aquaman and Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman 2 in pre-production, no other films are locked into the DC Extended Universe slate. With a 13-month gap between Justice League and Aquaman, 2018 will be a “reset year” for the studio to recalibrate their DC slate with more filmmaker-driven pictures focused on individual characters. They are deviating from their Marvel Studios competition by dumping the corporate mandate to put out particular films in a certain order.** \r\n\r\n>Right now the priority is the Flashpoint solo movie with Ezra Miller, Whedon’s Batgirl, Matt Reeves’ solo Batman movie, the Green Lantern Corps film, and two different Joker movies (one with Jared Leto and Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn, and director Todd Phillips’ unconnected solo Joker movie set in the ’80s).','Wonder Park',9,80,'2017-11-08 05:30:19'),('7bl6ia','Gong Shou Dao (GSD) Promo Teaser Jet Li and Jack Ma','','Ma',0,0,'2017-11-08 08:05:38'),('7bnkh8','Ranking this year\'s superhero movie villains (SPOILERS)','For me, this was a good year for superhero movies, so it was a little hard to rank the best villain, though I didn\'t have a hard time ranking the worst villain that appeared in a movie this year. \r\n\r\nAlso, please feel free to post your own ranking of the villains that appeared in a superhero film this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) **Adrian Toomes/The Vulture (Michael Keaton) - Spider-Man: Homecoming**\r\n\r\nThe Vulture was the best villain in a superhero film this year, because he was a fully fleshed out character, whose motivations for being a villain were clear. He was just an average working joe, who got screwed by the system and took steps to provide for his family. Plus, he was played by the incomparable Michael Keaton, one of the best actors working today, who made The Vulture extremely menacing [(especially in the car conversation scene where he confronts Peter)](#spoiler) and extremely memorable and is one of the best villains that we\'ve had yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) **Hela (Cate Blanchett) - Thor: Ragnarok**\r\n\r\nHela was also an extremely menacing villain and Blanchett knocks it out of the park here. She was able to convey a lot of emotions here and brings Thor to his lowest point, which is a lot more than we can say for the last Thor villain from The Dark World. I only wish that Hela was giving some more to do in the middle sections of Ragnarok.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) **[X-24 (Hugh Jackman)](#spoiler) - Logan**\r\n\r\n[What can I say about X-24? He was the perfect baddie to go toe-to-toe against Logan, in what would be the final villain that Logan would face in his final appearance on screen. X-24 didn\'t even have to say anything, he just conveyed emotions and actions that showed he was a raging, brutal killing machine, especially in the house assault scene as he murders an entire family and mortally wounds Charles Xavier.

Well, let\'s just say that as a villain, he was very underwhelming. I felt that as Peter Quill\'s father, he was very good. He showed the audience that he could be a likable, funny character and also showed us some of the same qualities that we see in Peter. But, I really didn\'t buy the whole terraforming worlds to become an ultimate god. That\'s not to say that Russell was terrible as the villain. I think Kurt Russell is like Michael Keaton, he\'s one of the best veteran actors working today, but I just didn\'t buy his whole character turning on a dime to become the big baddie at the end of the film.](#spoiler)\r\n\r\n\r\n5) **Ares - Wonder Woman**\r\n\r\nFinally, we get to Ares. In what I, undoubtedly, think is the worst villain this year, is the final villain that Diana/Wonder Woman faces in the film. Throughout the whole film, the audience is led to believe that a couple of key characters are going to be the ultimate villain, but when the actual character is revealed to be [Sir Patrick (David Thewlis)](#spoiler) and he begins to reveal his plan, I was reminded of [Ego in Guardians 2](#spoiler), a character that is revealed to be the villain in the film\'s third act. He was not menacing enough and not memorable enough to be a truly great villain and that\'s why he\'s at the bottom of the list. Don\'t get me wrong. I really liked the film, but the villain was one of the only flaws that I found with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to post your rankings of this year\'s superhero movie villains.','Wonder Park',9,52,'2017-11-08 14:07:43'),('7bu9to','\'Aladdin\': Meet the Cast of Disney\'s Live-Action Reboot','','Aladdin',18,30,'2017-11-09 11:10:45'),('7bzoin','Jet Li New Film GSD Teaser #2 with Jack Ma','','Ma',2,0,'2017-11-10 02:30:35'),('7c44c9','What movie ACTUALLY deserves all of the hate it gets?','There\'s a bunch of movies that have gotten a bunch of hate.

No wonder Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar for this performance.\r\n\r\nThis was also my first John Wayne movie and i was surprised by his performance.I had heard that he plays overtly masculine characters but Ringo Kid is a character of romantic innocence,modesty,heroism and Wayne plays with smooth confidence.\r\n\r\nEven though the film is black and white and it mutes the desert atmosphere of a Western movie, John Ford\'s direction shines through. Lots of beautiful scenes,fantastic character interaction and melodious music.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the film is a timeless narrative, a stagecoach filled with people from different walks of life has to travel through Apache lands to reach their destination.

Some random Indonesian movie that few of us had heard of, The Raid, was thrown into the mix and quickly thrown back out. Eventually we had settled for Ridley Scott’s Prometheus mainly at my insistence, which turned out to be a terrible decision and a catastrophic error, given the film was so disappointing that hardly any of those guys who I went to see the film with ever showed up for another cinema outing since. \r\n\r\nA few months down the line, I had the opportunity to but this Indonesian flick. By this time, it had gained a reputation as something of a hit in the action movie world. I didn’t have my hopes very high going in, given that we live in a time where The Dark Knight is considered an action masterpiece by many, when I don’t even feel it’s an action movie to begin with. Still, there was no harm that could be found in trying this film out, so I gave it a go. \r\nTo put it simply The Raid just took my breath away. It hit me like a whirlwind. This small, plucky Indonesian flick jumped straight to my number 1 in my list of best action films of the 21st century. It was insanely visceral, intense and leaves you wanting to walk out the front door and punch someone in the face. What the Raid is essentially is a collection of incredibly crafted, wild and fast bouts of hyper violent martial arts fights set in the claustrophobic and tight corridors of a high rise apartment block. \r\n\r\nThe story involves a SWAT team who infiltrate an apartment block and work their way up the floors one at a time, their goal being to capture a drug kingpin who resides at the top. Their cover is blown however, and many are taken out in a frenzy of bullets, leaving just a few commandos scattered around the building. The kingpin announces through a comms that a price is now on the heads of the cops, giving them even more to worry about now pretty much everyone in the building is trying to kill them. Cue enough extreme segments of violence and inventive fights scenes that you could want in a single film. \r\n\r\nThe story, interestingly quite similar to Dredd’s a year later, is pretty thin but serves its purpose. It allows for a movie where the fights scenes have the added element of feeling suffocating due to the lack of space in these tight corridors. Just round the corner could be a trio of thugs armed with machetes or rifles, or an unforgiving dead end. The respite between fight scenes last mere minutes before we’re thrown into another relentless exploiting of chops, kicks, twirls and punches. Broken bones and bloody faces become a norm and director Gareth Evans brilliant camera work forces you to be right in the thick of things, up close and personal and given the performers know their stuff, there’s no need for quick cuts or shakey cam. The fights are so excellently choreographed and filmed, you never lose track of what’s going on. \r\n\r\nIko Uwais plays Rama, one of the police officers. He’s a Muslim too, which was a nice touch, and in the tranquil opening 5 minutes or so before the frenzy of craziness, he prays, works out, kisses his wife goodbye before being launched into this hell hole. We come to see that Rama is the hero of the film, and Uwais is really going to be one to watch in the future. He’s already reached the levels of Tony Jaa in the martial arts world in my opinion and in a few years might have the likes of Donny Yen looking over his shoulders. The man is just so fast, and complements the aesthetically pleasing fight choreography so well. We learn that Rama’s brother is part of the gang that the cops are battling against, and there are several instances of allegiance switching which keep the story fresh in and amongst all the fighting. \r\n\r\nIt’s difficult to find faults in this movie, providing you know what you’re in for. Even the blood effects on a measly budget look superior to a lot of Hollywood movies out nowadays. I guess one complaint I would have is that after a while it all became too much. I became exhausted by the time the final three way fight at the end of the film came into place, too sanitised, and found myself drifting off. I have to point the finger and blame the very same thing that is the film’s best strength – the tight fast fights. There’s only so long a viewer can keep engaged with the intensity. You have to space it out a bit more and let things sink in, something which Evans learned for his next film. \r\n\r\nStill by and large the film leave you feeling breathless. It’s a terrific crowd-pleaser that puts to shame a lot of the fight scene from its Hollywood counterparts. Throw CGI and shakey cam out the window, because this is the real stuff. Even the environment gets in on the action, with fridges and tables being thrown about, people smashing through windows and using anything they can find as a weapon. It’s new and impressive in how the action is shot, but old school in the heroism you feel coming from the main characters. They’re thrown into a perilous fight or die situation that feels genuine. \r\n\r\nIt’s not all crash band wollop. Like I said the story development isn’t bad, and Evans is clever is how he films and edits the already impressive fight scenes. For example there’s a one on one that quickly increases in tempo and intensity, As the arms and legs are flying around the music is pumping harder and harder, until Rama grips the goons head and smashes it through a broken door, slicing the insides of his face, and suddenly everything stops. The music is gone, the camera is still. We don’t see that last bit with the face and the door though, it cuts away just before the guy gets it, and instead we are focus on a weary looking Rama, breathing heavily looking almost shaken at his handiwork while he regains his breath. I don’t know why, but in and amongst all the fighing that is the shot I remember most vividly from the film. \r\n\r\nThe Raid feels very tight, no laggy fat at all. It’s short, intense, and packs a hell of a punch. When you look at the great action films over the years, Die Hard, Hard Boiled and then the great martial arts movies over the years Drunken Master, Enter the Dragon, The Raid offers something that feels very different. None of those films match the intensity of The Raid, the speed of it. The adrenaline it pumps into you cements it as a modern day action classic in my opinion. After seeing the film and then watching another action flick from this century, iron man, Rambo, even Ip man and SPL, in terms of sheer ferocity, nothing comes close. Nothing seems to satisfy. That is of course, until you get to the movie’s superior sequel. But that’s a review for another day. I give The Raid an 8.5 \r\n','The Dead Don\'t Die',53,30,'2017-11-22 09:36:14'),('7evhw1','SMALLFOOT - Teaser Trailer','','Abominable',115,20,'2017-11-22 19:04:55'),('7f5nbt','AN OPEN SECRET.

I get it\'s much darker, creepier tone and vibe isn\'t for everybody, but that\'s what I enjoyed about it, how it dares to be darker, bolder and not retread Raiders Of The Lost Ark again. Unlike others I never minded that the Nazis weren\'t the enemies as using them again so soon in the subsequent film. The Thugges were a good threat in their own right and Mola Ram for me is hands down the best, most menacing and memorable villain of the series. This movie showed Nazis aren\'t always needed for an Indiana Jones movie and showed how fine he can work without them. There\'s so many amazing setpieces and moments throughout the film, from the escape from Club Obi-Wan to the temple itself and it\'s many great sets such as the spike chamber, the sacrificial chamber and then we get the epic mine cart chase (doubtlessly my favorite moment in the series) and the showdown on the bridge. The most cutthroat yet heroic version of Indy in the series, the best and most dynamic music score... I can go on and on about what\'s great about this film. Plus unlike others I never minded Short Round and Willie Scott, though I get some finding the latter annoying.\r\n\r\nI often feel alone in thinking this movie is the best (or at the very least, the best alongside Raiders). A lot of the reasons people give for not liking it (much darker than the others, no Nazis, different mythology) are part of why I enjoy it so much because it dares to be different and isn\'t just content with being a Raiders copycat as Last Crusade was (good as that film was, it\'s undeniably just trying to be Raiders 2.0 rather than something more unique). While I acknowledge Raiders is the best of the series in many ways and I\'d never argue with anyone saying it is, for me, TOD is the most entertaining and rewatchable, as well as the one truest to the pulpy roots that inspired the character in the first place.

Why is a scene involving lemons infamous? Having lemons in a refrigerator is nothing groundbreaking or worthy of internet snark. It is the way the lemons are presented that has confounded audiences for well over a decade.  The issue the nitpickers have revolves around the lemons resting nicely in a big bowl in the middle of Jon Voight’s refrigerator.  It is a one-second scene in a two-hour movie that has joined the ranks of world-famous mysteries like Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, and magnets.\r\n\r\n[Watch the clip to get a feel for the scene] (https://youtu.be/WTA7KR9-9lM)\r\n\r\nIn my quest to be more like Benjamin Gates I’ve watched the scene over and over and did some lemon research to best guess why he had those lemons in a bowl in the middle of his refrigerator.\r\n\r\nHere is how the scene plays out. Nic Cage and crew steal the Declaration of Independence in Washington D.C. and make their getaway to Philadelphia to hideout in Jon Voight’s house. They realize they need lemons for the declaration and the scene starts to take place.\r\n\r\n**Here are the clues I’m working with:**\r\n\r\n1. They start their drive from Washington D.C to Philadelphia well after sunset (7:30PM) around 9:00PM.\r\n\r\n2. Mr. Voight has a sizable bar that looks to be loaded with cognac, gin and Irish whiskey. Also, to the left of the bar there is a decanter filled with a mystery booze.\r\n\r\n3. If you look to the left of the characters during the clip you will see several glasses filled with iced tea and lemon.\r\n\r\n4. When Harvey Keitel is at the house later on you will notice there is a half-filled iced-tea pitcher.\r\n\r\n5. There is a bowl of apples and bananas in the same place where the iced tea glasses are\r\n\r\n6. There is a massive library inside the house\r\n\r\n7. Next to the apples and iced tea glasses there are poker chips.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Here are the Benjamin Gates style deductions:**\r\n\r\n1. They arrived in Philadelphia around 12:30AM which means a late night lemon pickup was pretty impractical. Also, the van they were driving in was being searched for so they would want to keep it off the road. This means the lemons had to be in the house.\r\n\r\n2. Before they say “we need more lemons” they already have a cut up lemon in a tiny bowl. This means that they must’ve found the lemons in the refrigerator, taken them out of the bag and placed them in a bowl in the middle of the refrigerator. Nothing in his refrigerator looks organized, so I highly doubt that Voight would organize them in a bowl.\r\n\r\n3. After looking at various retailer websites it seems that there are approximately ten lemons in a two pound bag that is commonly sold. Due to the contents of his fridge it seems clear that he would rather grab a bag of lemons then pick them individually. \r\n4. Due the contents of the refrigerator and the large pizza box I’m guessing that Voight rarely cooks. Thus, I don’t see him making lemon chicken or anything of the sort. Also, you won’t see him making any lemon cheesecake bars.\r\n\r\n5. There were no lemons in Harvey’s iced tea. Thus, they were all used or Jon Voight straight up dissed Harvey.\r\n\r\n6. The inclusion of poker chips means that Voight most likely has a weekly game with several of his friends. The lemons could easily be used with iced tea and various drinks.\r\n\r\n**Lemon hot take:** After several discussions about the lemons I’ve learned there is a small group of people who believe Voight placed the lemons in the bowl himself. The reasoning is he decided to wash all the lemons at once instead of cleaning one at a time. After the cleaning he placed them in the bowl. This would make it easier for him to access. I think these people are delusional.\r\n\r\n**Why were the lemons in the refrigerator?**\r\n\r\n1. The loaded bar and empty contents of a wine bottle suggest that Jon Voight likes the occasional drink. I didn’t see any mixers in his bar or house so it looks as if he likes his booze neat or on the rocks. Lemon may seem like an odd garnish but it combines nicely with a whiskey hot toddy or gin/vodka tonics.\r\n\r\n2. During the inspection of the declaration I’m deducing that Voight set them up with a nice pitcher of caffeinated iced tea. It was already late so they needed something cool and refreshing to keep them up. The fact that there are lemons inside the drinks show he is used to entertaining people (Poker) at his house and has no problem using lemons in their drinks/cocktails.\r\n\r\n3. He has a massive library and since he is eating dinner at 12:00AM I’m assuming he likes to stay up late and read. Since he loves making iced tea,  he most likely enjoys brewing tea. Perhaps he likes to make lemon tea (needs half a lemon for squeezing) or cuts up a piece of lemon for his tea. The lemon has a nice detoxification element and helps with immune system building and digestion.\r\n\r\n4. After researching lemon drinks in Philadelphia I found a treasure trove of articles talking about drinks and lemons. People love their iced tea, lemon shandys, and lemonade. Also, I managed an annual event in Philly and many of my volunteers could be seen with half gallon iced tea jugs from WaWa (they were obsessed). Thus, the dude loved his city and embraced drinks that could benefit from a lemon.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** The lemons were already at the house and were most likely used for cocktail garnishes and iced/hot tea flavoring. They were in the middle of the refrigerator because Nic Cage pulled the lemons from the crisper and placed them in the bowl for easier future use. The mystery has been solved (or potentially creates more mysteries….)!\r\n\r\nA Quick Pitch: If National Treasure 3 is ever made I think it should be about Nic Cage and crew rescuing a kidnapped Kurt Russell (dude is a national treasure).\r\n\r\nIf you liked this post make sure to check out my other “dumb data” posts!

She will get and deserve those nominations after years of hard work. However in terms of directing this is her first solo directorial debut. Her first directorial debut was a co directorial and that was 9 years ago. So what I don’t understand is  why all of a sudden she a contender for a directing nomination. This is her only second movie she directs in since 2008. She wasn’t even nominated for the independent spirit award for best director. What makes her so different from thousands of other indie directors who did multiple films never getting an Oscar nom. Look at her boyfriend Noah baumbach he makes good indie movies, leader of the mublecore movement in which gerwig is a follower, not to mention has a longer directing career than Greta, and is also her mentor. yet the squid and the whale is is his only movie that broke into oscars and only had a screenplay nomination no directing.

There is still one studio that owns Marvel characters that seems to be willing to take big risks with CBM like Fox did.

And it\'s been attracting major (And somewhat selective) talent like the Zombieland director, the Saving Mr Banks writer, WETA, Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Woody Harrelson, Riz Ahmed, Jenny Slate, and Scott Haze.

I\'ve seen so many negative reviews for it\'s revisionist history solely due to the fact that PT Barnum was actually quite an awful person in real life and isn\'t in the movie. While I can\'t argue against that point I can say:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Commodus was a well liked ruler that actually led his people for over a decade and did not die in the arena. Gladiator won 5 Academy Awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n- William Wallace and King Edward did not die at the same time. Isabella was 13 at the time of Wallace\'s death and had not even married Edward yet. They somehow left out a bridge in the film during The Battle of Sterling Bridge. Braveheart won 5 Academy Awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Pocahontas was 10 during the actual events of the movie. She then later was captured, married a different man, changed her name to Rebecca, became a Christian, and then died at the age of 21. Well that\'s not the beloved Disney movie I grew up with...\r\n\r\n\r\n- John Nash had a number of sexual relationships with men and was actually a pretty big asshole in real life especially to his son and wife. A Beautiful Mind won 4 Oscars.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I\'m not saying that The Greatest Showman is an Oscar worthy movie on the same caliber as those I named but I\'ve seen far too many reviews in the negative because of it being inaccurate and not because of the film itself.\r\n\r\n','21 Bridges',341,148,'2017-12-25 11:57:50'),('7m5ugw','[Spoilers] It certainly wasn\'t the best movie of the year, but the movie Split, provided me with the biggest WOW moment of maybe any movie I ever saw.','It really was the movie that stuck with me the most last year.

It\'s amazing to me that the last 15 seconds of a movie can make the entire movie so much better. I\'m half surprised I even kept watching Shyamalan\'s films since they have been largely awful for what seems like more then a decade. It\'s just his first 4 or 5 were so awesome (I loved Signs and The Village) I kept hoping for a return to form. And every year or two I would do a search to see if there was any chance there would be a sequel to Unbreakable. Always disappointed.

That pushed the film past $500M domestic, with a current haul of $533M. That means it\'s surpassed the lifetime domestic gross of Beauty and the Beast (2017) making it domestically the highest grossing film of 2017. In fact that makes it the first time ever a franchise has had the #1 domestic grosser of the year for three consecutive years. It also means that now 8 out of the 10 theatrically released Star Wars films have managed to make it to #1 in their respective year (Attack of the Clones and Clone Wars were the only exceptions). In comparison The MCU has released 16 films and only one (The Avengers) has had the biggest gross of the year. It should also be noted TLJ was the second fastest a film has crossed $500M doing so in just 16 days (below of course The Force Awakens which did it in 10). The film also crossed the magic $1B worldwide mark this week, doing so in just 19 days. Yet despite all that it\'s fair to notice that things don\'t quite look like the homerun they could be. For one, this weekend TLJ was dangerously close to Jumanji: WTTJ which had a huge jump up this week while TLJ dropped 26.4%. That isn\'t a huge drop but compared to say Jumanji gaining 38% it doesn\'t look good. The film also did not get the #2 spot for the highest New Year\'s Day gross but rather the #6 spot with $15.7M behind...Jumanji which got the #5 spot with $16.1M. It is not only under The Force Awakens on that day but also under Rogue One as well which up to now TLJ has consistently beat on every metric. And this is a New Year\'s Day on a Monday, usually the best possible placement for films to have a fabulous daily gross. The fact TLJ couldn\'t deliver here speaks volumes. There\'s a lot of possible reasons for TLJ\'s weakening holds: the backlash from many in the fandom, the extended length, and just the darker tone overall. This is not to say TLJ is a flop (remember it made more domestically than EVERY other film released this year in just three weeks) but there does seem to be a cooling effect coming. The big test will be Solo which was only #5 on Fandago\'s most anticipated of 2018 survey and doesn\'t even have a full poster/trailer yet despite being less than six months away. And then if Solo bombs, we have a year and a half break until Episode IX which could really damage the brand. The big issue is this was a rough year for franchise fair that followed roughly reviewed films, especially Transformers: The Last Knight and Justice League. Disney may not have a serious problem on their hands now, but TLJ may be the spark that starts the fire that burns the whole franchise down. \r\n\r\n* **Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle -** While The Last Jedi continued its odd mix of extreme success and weird downward spiral, Jumanji: Welcome the Jungle continued its incredibly surprising box office run as it very closely raced behind TLJ with an amazing second weekend with $66.5M for the four-day. That marks a 38% increase for the three-day weekend, one of the best holds ever for a film in wide release. If that wasn\'t enough the film also managed to actually beat TLJ for the New Year\'s Day box office with $16.1M, the fifth best New Year\'s Day haul ever and was almost enough for the film to squeak by TLJ\'s four day gross. Coming into the the Christmas release it felt like Jumanji was a big gamble, a nostalgic remake with a big budget mostly do to its big paycheck commanding stars. However the film has just had amazing holds, even more than TLJ where it\'s barely dropped and often even gained during the weekdats. New Year\'s Day couldn\'t come at a better time for the film, as the box office always sees a major bum when it lands on a Monday and Jumanji was the best choice for kids out of school, becoming the family film of the Christmas season. Currently the film is rocketing towards $200M domestic, a major end of year gift for Sony who have a lot of ups and downs this year (and hell had a lot of ups and downs just this week). \r\n\r\n* **All the Money in the World -**  While Sony was having a great week with Jumanji they couldn\'t quite celebrate all around as the quickly reshot film All the Money in the World had its first wide release weekend at #7 with $7.5M for the four-day. The film became one of many films and TV shows tainted by the wave of harassment allegations the rocked Hollywood towards the end of 2017. This time the accusations were against Kevin Spacey who originally was starring in the film as J. Paul Getty, but was accused by multiple people of sexual assault. Instead of doing the expected and delaying or even shelving the film director Ridley Scott did perhaps the craziest move possible and quickly recast the role with Christopher Plummer and in nine days reshoot all 22 of Spacey\'s original scenes, pushing back the film\'s release date by just 3 days. The reshoots are a remarkable filmmaking achievement in terms of production but they did add a hefty $10M to the budget ballooning it to $50M total. The most obvious issue for the marketing is that it meant Sony also had to drop all the advertising with Spacey and quickly scramble to sell the film with Plummer. The film was released Christmas Day to a decent opening but hasn\'t expanded at all and this first weekend could barely hold despite being the most profitable weekend of the year. Since we don\'t have the ability to see the alternate universe where Spacey isn\'t a harasser and the film was released as is we can\'t know for sure if this was just disinterest or the reshoots caused too much confusion in the marketplace. I don\'t think Sony will be mad about the choice to reshoot the film over scrapping it (better to cover some costs on $50M then no costs on $40M) but I don\'t think Ridley\'s choice will be one we will ever see repeated again. \r\n\r\n* **Oscar Movie Round-up -** It seems we have finally found our Oscar race box office hit as **Darkest Hour** once again had a great expansion, adding 137 theaters for a total of 943 closing out the four-day weekend with $7.5M. The film starring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill has been the major front-runner for Best Actor which is always a significant boom (see: The Revenant). Box office and awards consideration are often a two-headed beast so this box office run may increase Oldman\'s chances and as Oldman\'s chances increase the box office increases and so on. The caliber of a film matters for awards but so does popularity (think Get Out would be a front-runner if it only made $30M?) and with this renewed interest Oldman may well stand out from the pack now. This week also saw the expansion of two well reviewed movies that feels like they are just on the fringes of Oscar consideration. The first is **Molly\'s Game**, the directorial debut of writer Aaron Sorkin, a biopic about Molly Bloom and her extremely successful illegal poker games. The film debuted this week in 271 theaters to $2.3M, a per theater average of $8,598. While solid it\'s not quite the level of previous Sorkin openings like The Social Network or even Steve Jobs. With lead Jessica Chastain seemingly out of the best actress race and Sorkin\'s script at best in third place for Best Adapted (behind Call Me By Your Name and The Disaster Artist) I think this film will just be lost in the pack. Finally this week saw the opening of **Phantom Thread**, the latest film from Paul Thomas Anderson and supposedly the final performance ever by Daniel Day Lewis, which opened in 4 theaters to $295,000, a per theater average of $73,750. Surprisingly Lewis has not been a major force in the Best Actor race despite being the only person in history to win that category three times. That said PTA has always been more of a critical darling than an Oscar one and it seems this year will be the same. The film has been beloved by critics but doesn\'t seem to have any heat on it besides Best Original Screenplay which is one of the tightest races of the year. It doesn\'t help either that PTA has never been a box office draw as well (Jumanji: WTTJ made more in two weeks than every film PTA has ever made combined) so this one will probably be like all the other PTA films: a box office disappointment with no Oscar love but beloved by critics and cinephiles. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

I will never see les miserables, and other than La La Land, I\'ve never had a reason to see a movie-musical. So when I saw the preview for The Greatest Showman, I thought it would suck. Like really suck. I was probably just being cynical, but I couldn\'t make myself pay to see Zac Efron and Zendaya sing. \r\n\r\nHowever, after it came out, multiple people in my friend group told me that they loved it. I was surprised, as they were both high school boys, and the thought had never crossed my mind that it wouldn\'t be complete crap. Anyway, I was super bored this weekend, so I invited them to see it with me, solely because of their glowing recommendations.\r\n\r\nSo, I saw it. And it was really entertaining and good. This is really a movie that you can\'t be cynical or pessimistic going into. You have to embrace it and not get upset when the pace moves so fast that things don\'t seem possible. The events in the film come by so fast near the beginning, but it doesn\'t mess up the film.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that\'s about the only problems with it, that I can really call problems.

The opening of the film starts off with a song that pumps you up and gets you excited, and it only keeps going from there. Even the kid singing in A Million Dreams, Ziv Zaifman, was fantastic. Out of the 9 real songs in the film, I bet I will easily remember 5 or 6 of them. \r\n\r\nThe best songs IMO are The Greatest Show, A Million Dreams, The Other Side, Never Enough (incredible), Rewrite the Stars, and This is Me, though the other ones are still very good, just not as memorable in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe film also has a very good message that would be great for basically anyone to watch. The message and continued showing that the unique outcasts in the circus were just as / even more unique and great than the rest of society is just a nice message. It\'s really a feel good movie, and it does a great job at it. There really isn\'t much conflict in the film, but it\'s actually not a problem for me in this one. \r\n\r\nI was extremely surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did, and it would be a perfect date movie, perfect movie for kids, or just a good movie if you like musicals.\r\n\r\nThere are countless problems that just don\'t matter because of the film genre.

It’s directed by James Gray and stars Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones as father & son. The son is apparently trying to reach his father who is in deep space or something. It sounds a lot like Interstellar, with this great ambitious deep space movie with a really emotional core. Brad Pitt rarely involves himself in bad movies, and he & James Gray showed with The Lost City of Z that they can make a movie with a realistic portrayal of something that’s almost laughable to take seriously. I have super high hopes for this movie despite not knowing much about it. The *Interstellar* production crew is apparently working on this as well. [Here’s the IMDB](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2935510/)\r\n\r\nSo TL;DR- the ingredients are: a very good director, Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, it’s an emotional space epic, it’ll probably have very ambitious visuals, great cast & crew, but it also has a January release date. \r\n\r\nCan anyone shed more light on this movie?? \r\n\r\nedit: the more you read into this movie, the better it sounds. photos from around the set look incredible, and Brad Pitt called the shoot “hostile”. this shit has me so hyped man','Ad Astra',0,5,'2018-01-19 02:38:05'),('7rh4c','Sundance Film Review: THE INFORMERS - Amber Heard gets very naked','','The Informer',0,0,'2009-01-21 17:53:35'),('7rrk7x','Stanley Kubrick\'s The Shining [1980] - The scariest horror movie ever?','Consider the moment Doc Holleran is watching the news in his bed in Florida. The camera is slowly moving in on him. Nothing is happening, but an ominous feeling comes to you. Suddenly Doc looks up with his mouth open and it softly transitions to Room 237 from the perspective of Jack Torrance. There is little music, just a screeching violin and a heartbeat. Some horns play dissonant notes. And then a beautiful woman naked in the bathtub appears. Jack looks transfixed, but is reveling in what he sees as the naked woman slips out of the bathroom and walks towards him.\r\n\r\nThere is very little that happens here in these 3 minutes. But the intensity, the psychological fear that awaits you and everyone else is palpable. What the hell is happening? But I am scared! The repeating laughter of the old woman is haunting. \r\n\r\nSo why is this movie scary? Kubrick sets up disorientation very early in the film. In fact, the credit sequence alone is enough to make you feel unsettled. The credits scroll up, contrary to most going down. The dissonant music from Bela Bartok, Krystof Penderecki and Gyorgi Ligetti are used to perfection to create an atmosphere of chaos. Wendy Carlos writes the score. I wonder if there was an intentional use of her as part of the confusion, the upsetting of everything, as prior to this film, she worked on Kubrick\'s Clockwork Orange - only as Walter Carlos. Yes, she had a sex change. \r\n\r\nThe film starts to get unhinged early on as winter settles in. Jack looking over the maze and the camera zooms in closer and closer until we see two specks moving around. As we get closer we realize its Wendy and Danny discovering the path for themselves. Jack never knowing how to navigate. We know this sets up the film for later. But I believe the plot is incidental to the scares. In fact, when things get really crazy in real life, the plot gets kind of drowned out in favor of details being amplified. Heartbeats. People saying ambiguous things. Everything gets plucked out of context and we analyze it out of rationality. \r\n\r\nI dont want to carry on too much, but I will leave a final point about what makes this film scary is in part Kubrick\'s tracking shots and quick zooms. The quick zooms he has used extensively in Dr. Strangelove. The tracking shots gives an unease at the slow build, a type of anxiety, while at the same time giving movement and establishing environment. Then with slow transitions at certain scenes and then a punctuation of the time or date all adds up to just weirdness that will keep you jumping. \r\n\r\nI did not point out every single incident or technique, but wanted to stress the point that Kubrick understands human psychology a lot better than we might give him credit. This coupled with his knowledge and patience of the filmmaking process makes for brilliant cinema.','Torrance',0,14,'2018-01-20 12:04:24'),('7s29ch','VIEWER WARNING: Netflix \'Open House\' is one of the worst horror films I\'ve ever seen (SPOILERS)','I watched the new Netflix original horror film \'Open House\' last night and it was egregiously awful. From the disconnected plot threads that are setup and go no where to the unforgivably terrible ending, I couldn\'t believe anybody signed off on this film being rushed through to production. Spoilers ahead.\r\n\r\nThe fathers death at the beginning of the film played no further role throughout the film except to move the mother and son into the open house. \r\n\r\nWhen setting up the \'horrors of the house\' the basement scene\'s seemed to be setting up something paranormal, particularly the shot of the blocked off hallway that didn\'t end up going anywhere. The trailer in particular spent considerable energy accentuating the basements importance, but the film never really did anything meaningful with it. \r\n\r\nThe fact that there\'s a huge focus on the son running a 5 minute mile, training endlessly for it didn\'t pay off in anyway. I kept thinking that this training would play an important role, the ability to outrun the criminal? To reach a police station before the mother died etc. But no, no reason what so ever.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the lady neighbour with dementia was another red herring. The film was clearly trying to make her seem like a villain in the story, but a third in it was revealed that she had alzheimer\'s, and that was pretty much the end of her role in the film. The shot of her delusionally wondering in the forest at the end had me in shouting \'What?!\' at the television. \r\n\r\nWhy did the son nonchalantly accept that the cereal had moved. That his phone appeared in the basement? Honestly logic and actual human behavior completely dissapeared in this film to a distracting rate.\r\n\r\nThe mother in the basement at the end was particularly awful. Apart from her clearly overly manufactured, rush at the son while he had a knife so she would be stabbed being terribly orchestrated nonsense, why was she there? What point was there. Why did the son back away? \r\n\r\nFinally the ending... The goddam ending. So it wasn\'t some grand conspiracy involving a satanic cult that worshiped a portal to hell in the basement, and it wasn\'t some ghostly apparition of the husband of the dementia woman next door because they secrectly used to live there and that\'s where there son was buried/died in a fire in the basement, no it wasn\'t the fact that the son died with the father and the mother had been living with the ghost of her son in the new house... nothing so interesting or twisted, instead it was... Some random dude. Just a random dude. Who goes to open houses, and kills the people living in them? K.\r\n\r\nHonestly I don\'t mind the horror premise that a killer attends open houses and stays, terrorising the inhabitants. But this film completely threw that idea out the window with a thousand random incomplete plot threads that didn\'t even touch on this idea...\r\n\r\nAll this is to say, this film was attrocious. Avoid like the fucking plague.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Open house should be closed permanently.

This week the film dropped just 28.7% coming in #1 for its third weekend in a row (and its fifth week overall) with $20M. The film has now surpassed $300M domestic and become the 7th highest grossing film of 2017, surpassing Thor: Ragnarok despite opening more than $85M less than that mega hit. The film is just a monster in terms of legs, nearing an insane 9x multiplier (Wonder Woman pulled a 4x multiplier and was considered a huge hit in terms of staying power). This film is just unstoppable, becoming the go to choice for an entire month while certain other hits have faded away (obviously I\'m talking Downsizing /s). It\'s also surpassed $750M worldwide surpassing the worldwide gross of hits like Logan and IT. While it hasn\'t reached quite the same heights of Avatar no film has really utilized the strength of the winter season this well since Avatar with each weekend acted like an opening weekend with no sign of slowing down. Finally some real competition is coming with 15:17 to Paris and Fifty Shades Freed in February, but that still weeks away and plays to a more adult audience. I\'m sorry but at some point you just have to stand back in awe. I give in, Jumanji you win. You have beaten me and everyone else. I\'m just going to sit back and watch your 10th victory lap.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **12 Strong -**  Usually when a film is in development hell for 5 years and changes its name just months before release and is released in the dead of January you have a grade-A megabomb on your hands but for once all that scrambling actually seems to have saved 12 Strong which opened to a solid $16.5M at #2, just above expectations. The film originally titled Horse Soldiers until about November was announced in 2011 but wasn\'t shot until 2016 by first time director Nicolai Fuglsig. The film\'s original marketing focused much harder on the whole soldiers on horses thing but after some terrible marketing surveys they changed the title to 12 Strong, pushing the horse stuff to the subtitle and rebranding the film to focus on the first unit to enter Afghanistan after 9/11. It was a smart move trying to appeal to the older, American Sniper crowd that seems to have worked. The film played to a crowd that was 79% over the age of 25 and they gave it an A on Cinemascore which should give some good legs in the coming weeks. With a budget of $30M the film should eek out a solid profit, not bad for something at the start of the year looked to perform so badly it would have to be considered for a government bailout. \r\n\r\n* **Den of Thieves -** Never count out Gerard as his latest shoot \'em up opened far above the usual STX standards and expectations opening in the double digits with $15.3M at #3. Going into the weekend it seemed STX expected to have a real stinker, predicting a sub $10M opening. Actually though it may not really be Gerard to thank for the minor success as 30% of the audience was black. Perhaps Gerard has an amazing black audience following but more likely the push was for 50 Cent who has his first lead in a theatrical film in a while as well as O\'Shea Jackson, the first major release of his since Straight Outta Compton (yes he was great in Ingrid Goes West but that topped out in less than 700 theaters and made less than Den of Thieves made opening day). We\'ve seen a lot of enthusiasm the last few years from black audiences who are fiercely loyal and tend to frankly not be well polled by early predictors. It will be interesting then to see where Black Panther lands opening weekend, but in the meantime Den of Thieves should hold well even with a B+ Cinemascore. It\'s not going to turn STX into a powerhouse but it is keeping the company on track and another good example of how desperately polling systems need to find ways to reach new expanding audiences. \r\n\r\n* **Forever My Girl -** Remember Nicholas Sparks and how he dominated romantic films for the past decade? Well now that his box office dominance is behind us we are experiencing the last gasps of his certain brand of romance and their imitators. So if Forever My Girl isn\'t the last film in this exhausting genre it will be truly shocking as the film opened at #10 with a terrible $4.7M. There\'s not much to really say here other than to say this is how trends end. Usually it\'s an imitator dying a sad quiet death, so awful it pretty much solidifies that a trend is finally over. Farewell Nicholas Sparks romance films, I personally won\'t miss you...so how long until the nostalgic Nicholas Sparks reboot?\r\n\r\n* **Oscar Movie Round-up -** Only a few days until the Oscar nominations are in so for now most of the films in the race didn\'t expand. First up is **The Post** which did not hold as well as I had thought dropping 37.2% to come in at #4 with $12.1M. The film doesn\'t seem to be translating that usual Spielberg good will into fantastic legs and with a likely shutout in major categories on Tuesday it will be tough for the film to stand out from the crowd. Surprisingly of the two big expansions this week **Phantom Thread** did the best, adding 800 theaters and earning $3.3M. It\'s surprising because director Paul Thomas Anderson has never been a box office smash, in fact his last film Inherent Vice closed to just $8M domestic. Not mention Phantom Thread\'s inspirations of Hitchcock and Max Ophuls aren\'t exactly nostalgic properties right now. It will be interesting to see how the film fairs since like most PTA films it seems to be in the low end of the pack of awards talk despite being one of the most critically beloved films of 2017. The only other expansion and the last of the Oscar hopefuls did not fair so well as **Call Me By Your Name** added 641 theaters but only managed to earn $1.5M. There\'s certainly the element of the film\'s openly gay content that may not be suitable for mass markets or the fact much like Phantom Thread it\'s a critical darling left out of most of the major races, but I think the big factor that ruined this film was time. It came out 9 weeks ago in limited and stayed in coastal cities for 5 weeks. The result is film twitter and critics moved on from the film by this point, so there was just zero momentum or sense that the film was finally hitting wide. Sony Pictures Classics banked on there being a lot more momentum from awards by this point but since there wasn\'t, so CMBYN was just old news by the time it was released. \r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

I proceeded to get sucked into an enchanting story of mystery, adventure and revelation into the depths of an ancient tale that I had never heard of. The ride was incredible, the story was captivating, and I truly thought I was watching one of the greatest discoveries in recent archeology unfold before my eyes. That was until the very last frame in the movie... There was Mickey mouse, covered in coral.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t believe what I just saw, my current world had just gotten flipped upside down and my flood of emotions had just turned to confusion and a bit of anger. Immediately I hopped onto my computer and went straight to Google, sure enough, the unfairly named documentary was actually a mockumentary. Damien Hirste was indeed a real artist, but nothing about the story of TftWotU was real. I then got to look at all the other pieces he made, and I think the movie did an amazing job of keeping out the ones that would have ruined the surprise. I also got to see the art world critics of the internet rip Damien a new asshole for the real life exhibit that just recently ended in Venice.\r\n\r\nFor those who watched, what did you think? Did you go in knowingly, and get your heart broken? Or was it an amazing experience in an artistic style you had never even imagined? \r\n\r\nI personally am ecstatic I got to watch not knowing what the end result was going to be, and think the concept behind this was astounding. But I am disappointed to learn the quality of some works were cheap and rushed and the monetary incentives behind the exhibit were clearly greedy and for massive profit.

Here is the list in full.\r\n\r\n* Doug and Henry did not meet at a freshman mixer. Henry was in the class above Doug.  \r\n* *Bored of the Rings* was published after Doug and Henry graduated from college. So was the Time parody.  \r\n* Peter Ivers was Doug’s Harvard classmate, but he was not a member of the Harvard Lampoon.  \r\n* Doug did not have to persuade Henry into starting the magazine. Henry was on board from the beginning.  \r\n* The Harvard Lampoon did field a team of children to play softball for them, but that happened in the 1990s.  \r\n* Doug and Henry had met Matty Simmons earlier — he helped them sell ads for the 1968 Harvard Lampoon parody of Life magazine.  \r\n* There was a third founder of National Lampoon named Rob Hoffman. Hoffman negotiated the contracts with Matty, but soon left to join his father’s soft-drink business in Dallas.  \r\n* Anne Beatts, Tony Hendra, and Brian McConnachie were not part of the Lampoon at its birth. They joined later.  \r\n* Tony Hendra performed on *The Ed Sullivan Show* with a partner, Nic Ullett.  \r\n* Anne Beatts’s confrontation with a construction worker is based on a sketch she wrote for Saturday Night Live.  \r\n* Mogdar is technically a dwarf planet.  \r\n* Doug appeared on Tom Snyder’s talk show with Chris Miller.  \r\n* Dough and Tony Hendra didn’t “swap vices” — it was Tony and Michael O’Donoghue who did.  \r\n* The “Marshmallows” piece was written by “Robert Heit” — which may have been Doug’s pseudonym.  \r\n* That’s not Will Forte’s real hair.  \r\n* There are some mild spoilers below about the rest of the movie. You can keep reading, or just come back later. We’ll be here…  \r\n* The live show Lemmings actually came first, before the creation of the Radio Hour.  \r\nGild Radner was not in Lemmings. But she did perform in another production called The National Lampoon Show.  \r\n* As far as we know, Alex never walked in on Doug with another woman. But she did eventually learn about his affair with Mary.  \r\n* Doug first ran away from National Lampoon in 1971. He went to Martha’s Vineyard with Mary, and then later he went to see Peter Ivers and Lucy Fisher, who lived in Los Angeles.  \r\n* Ann Beatts and Michael O’Donoghue quite National Lampoon over the phone with Matty Simmons, not in the office.  \r\n* The editor who called 911 while in a fight with Matty was Ted Mann, not Tony Hendra.  \r\n* Doug’s brother Daniel succumbed to a long illness and died in 1968 when Doug was in college.  \r\n* Everyone was a lot more sexist and racist than they appear to be.  \r\nThe idea to do a stand-alone yearbook parody came from Matty Simmons, and it was based on a piece Doug and Michael O’Donoghue wrote for the magazine.  \r\n* Doug met Kathryn Walker at a party at her apartment, not at a bar. But he did bite into a wine glass like a crazy person.  \r\n* Chevy Chase was not there when Doug delivered goats to his parents. But Doug did but them goats.  \r\n* While on a date with Katherine, Doug sang “When You Wish Upon a Star” to her, but we couldn’t afford that song.  \r\n* The line about ships and sinking rats comes from Sean Kelly.  \r\n*Animal House* and *Caddyshack* were made for different studios. “Brad,” the studio executive, is a composite character.  \r\n* Doug showed a drawer full of cocaine to Rick Meyerowitz, not to Chris Miller.  \r\n* Doug saw *Airplane!* With Peter Ivers, not with Kathryn Walker. Also, it was Peter Ivers who found Doug’s uncased check.  \r\n* Doug and Henry did meet up in New York, but not the day of the *Caddyshack* press conference.  \r\n* Doug and Chevy didn’t go straight to Hawaii after the *Caddyshack* press conference. They first went to a two-week tennis camp in California.  \r\n* Michael O’Donoghue did not say, “How can you eat shrimp at a time like this?” To Tony Hendra. Harold Ramis said it to *Caddyshack* actor Michael O’Keefe.  \r\n* If you spot anything else we missed, please email us at corrections@gofuckoff.net.','Midway',61,4,'2018-01-28 04:07:13'),('7tlwor','First Image of Forest Whitaker as Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Drama-Biopic \'The Forgiven\'','','After',188,16,'2018-01-28 13:14:49');

I have been on a quest to watch all 56 Walt Disney Animation Studios movies, and so far this movie (along with *Zootopia*) is the funniest overall of the ones that I\'ve seen. The story was a fairly standard road trip film, and it was successful in being heartwarming and being a moral journey for Kuzco... but the movie excelled in it\'s humor. Kronk and Yzma are some of the most effective Disney villains that I\'ve seen. They are both hilarious in their antics, and they are the driving source of humor in the film. Kronk is one of the few Disney villains that I actually felt sympathy for, and I ended up routing for him by the end. I\'m actually kind of shocked by how funny and effective this movie was. *Chicken Little* (2005) is BY FAR the worst Disney movie I\'ve seen in my journey, and it\'s main flaw was that it was painfully unfunny. I\'ve come to learn that *Chicken Little* and *The Emperor\'s New Groove* had the same director (Mark Dindal). What the hell happened between 2000 and 2005 Mark?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7s0hoq/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dt0ywj6/)\r\n\r\n* [**Apocalypse Now** - I had never seen it before because I never knew which cut to watch, but I finally said fuck it and picked up the Redux version and I think it might be the first time since I\'ve ever seen a movie that I truly felt that this was just pure magic. There were whole scenes that were just completely remarkable, from the beginning to the end you just let the film roll over you like a tone poem and looked as if it was literally just filmed in the middle of an actual war. The themes and subtext of the movie are woven so well in the dialouge and narration. It\'s basically the perfect movie. All that shit you see in *Mad Max: Fury Road* and *Blade Runner 2049* has its roots in what *Apocalypse Now* put on film. The performances are basically perfect. Marlon Brando doesn\'t sound like the parodies of Marlon Brando, for the few moments he\'s on screen he\'s just visually arresting all on his own. Dennis Hopper\'s few moments are jittery and paranoid and give the entire moment they land at Kurtz\'s base the proper dread. It\'s just pure magic. I never realized how there was a whole second storyline about that surfer Lance. The movie is just as much about him as it is about Charlie\'s mission down river. Just incredible. It\'s a movie you should have in your collection. It think my only problem with it was that dinner scene wasn\'t really necessary, but those scenes were added back in the Redux. But they have so many good lines in them I can see why he put it back in the expanded release.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7s0hoq/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dt1aznl/)\r\n\r\n* [**Blade Runner: 2049** -  I won\'t spoil this film. It\'s easily my favorite film of 2017 (so far) that\'s not *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. It\'s one of the best looking movies I\'ve seen, and it\'s all thanks to the cinematographer and production designer (along with the director, of course). Each shot is long enough for me to take in the details of the scene. Even the smaller scenes that don\'t necessarily move the plot forward with critical information (like Gosling\'s character walking back into his apartment building) tells a visual story. It\'s my favorite Villeneuve film (I\'ve only seen *Arrival* and *Sicario*; yes, I need to see the other films) so far. It\'s just as great, if not better than the original *Blade Runner* film. Ryan Gosling gives a great performance (as usual; he chooses some of the most interesting films), and there is one particular moment where he shines. The rest of the guys also gave great performances (Ford, Bautista, Leto, etc.), but the women gave exceptional performances, particularly Ana de Armas (Joi) and Sylvia Hoeks (Luv). None of these roles were typical female roles and these characters develop in interesting ways. The plot is simple: Officer K (Gosling) is a blade runner who finds a lead on a case and must uncover the truth before a war breaks out between replicants and humans. There are twists and turns in this search for the truth and it\'s best to go in this movie without spoilers. Without spoiling anything, this movie addresses the overall theme of humanity in interesting and unexpected ways. I highly recommend this film to fans (and maybe non-fans) of *Blade Runner*.

I want to strap in my seatbelt and blast off on a journey through human civilization, from as early as possible to present day, with as little gaps in history as possible. I’ve never done a big marathon like this (the only marathons I’ve ever done have been of the Star Wars movies and various TV shows), so this is going to take WAY more than a day, or a weekend. I hope to bite a chunk out of it over spring break, then maybe watch one or two every night. The details of actually watching all of these movies in order are still in the works. I’ve been pretty busy lately, but I will do whatever it takes to fulfill my quest. \r\n\r\nHere is a bit of a timeline of what I have so far planned:\r\n\r\n63 BC- Spartacus\r\n0 AD- passion of the Christ \r\n0 AD- Ben Hur\r\n180 AD- Gladiator\r\n220 AD- Red Cliff, Red Cliff II \r\n570 AD- the message \r\n\r\n1200 AD- Kingdom of Heaven \r\n1227 AD- Mongol\r\n1300 AD- Braveheart \r\n\r\n1508 AD- the agony and the ecstasy\r\n1517 AD- Luther \r\n1559 AD- Elizabeth\r\n\r\n1644 AD- the warlords \r\n\r\n1693 AD- the crucible \r\n\r\n1780 AD- Amadeus \r\n\r\n1832 AD- Les Miserables \r\n\r\n1853 AD- 12 years a slave \r\n1863 AD- Glory \r\n1863 AD- Gangs of New York \r\n1864 AD- Lincoln\r\n\r\n1890 AD- lust for life \r\n1898 AD- there will be blood \r\n1905 AD-fiddler on the roof \r\n1908 AD- the last emperor\r\n1911 AD- Titanic \r\n1918 AD- Lawrence of Arabia \r\n\r\n1930 AD- to kill a mockingbird \r\n1936 AD- the kings speech\r\n\r\n1942 AD- Casablanca \r\n1945 AD- letters from Iwo Jima, flags from our fathers \r\n1947 AD- Schindler’s list \r\n1948 AD- Ghandi\r\n\r\n1965 AD- Selma \r\n1970 AD- Apollo 13\r\n1994 AD- Hotel Rwanda\r\n2011 AD- Zero Dark Thirty \r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I’ve got a lot of planning and watching ahead of me. BUT there are still many gaps I want to fill, and important events in areas of the world not depicted in these movies. I could probably double this list with WWII and civil war movies, but I want to keep it to a solid five or so Movies for each that really depicted those events from different perspectives. I would so grateful if anyone could help me out, whether that means suggesting movies to fill the gaps, replace bad movies, or remove movies that don’t contribute to the overall theme. \r\n\r\nI love history, I’m not the type of person who does amazing in history classes but I’ve seen very few semi-accurate historical fiction or nonfiction movies I wasn’t interested in (a fact I’m sure will soon change :D).

So I decided to figure out the odds of her being picked up by two Pterosaurs, dropped into a lagoon and eaten by a Mosasaurus.','Many people have been killed in the four Jurassic Park films. Whether it be getting smooshed by a Tyrannosaurus Rex or sideswiped by a clever Velociraptor we’ve been blessed with some gnarly dinosaur related deaths. The majority of the deaths have all happened somewhat organically due to the fact that on multiple occasions people been dumb enough to travel to islands filled with carnivorous monsters. Death is par for the course when battling dinosaurs and aside from Peter Stormare being dumb in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I’ve never really felt that they were unnecessary or cruel. However, there is one death in Jurassic World that has garnered a lot of attention for being straight up mean [clip here] (https://youtu.be/LBTE3aH5gpw). The destruction of Zara the assistant (Katie McGrath – long live A Princess for Christmas)  via two Pterosaurs and a Mosasaurus is unique because she is the first women to be killed onscreen in the franchise, and it is a very long and brutal demise that is brought forth by her being forced to be a babysitter.\r\n\r\nZara’s death has gotten a lot of press and her character is even considered to be a hero to some [(Thanks Cracked!)] (http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-jurassic-world-brutally-killed-its-biggest-hero/). I kinda love that one death in a film stuffed with murder via dinosaur has stood out and become a lightning rod. That is why I watched the movie again, took a ton of notes and analyzed pretty much every diagram of the park. The reason I did so much research is that I wanted to know the odds of Zara’s death. I’m not here to hate on the film, or create something snarky in regards to Jurassic World. If you’ve read my other stuff you know I love filling in the blanks via educated guesswork, randomness and burning a lot of my free time.\r\n\r\n**What are the odds that Zara the assistant would be picked up by two Pterosaurs, dumped into the massive lagoon, and swallowed whole by a Mosasaurus while at Jurassic World?**\r\n\r\nAs I tracked Zara’s progress through the park I originally came up with odds that were astronomical (1 in 300 billion). After a lot of soul-searching (via punch dancing in abandoned warehouses) I decided to go with a more pragmatic approach. I originally included divorce rates, square mileage, aviary destruction and stupidity in the equation. But, after talking to people who are much smarter than I am, I was able to narrow down the odds and get it to something that slightly resembles a believable number.\r\n\r\nHere we go! \r\n\r\nSidenote: There is no way to know the exact answer. However, I’ve tried to be as pragmatic as possible in an effort to make this number somewhat practical.\r\n\r\n1. Jurassic World had been open for 10 years (all year round = 3,650 days) and they never had an animal escape.  – (**1 in 3,650**)\r\n\r\n2. According to park numbers, there were 21,216 guests at the park.\r\n\r\n3. I’m guessing that 150 Pterosaurs (and other flying beasts) escaped when the Indomnious Rex and helicopter crashed into the aviary. Let’s say one-in-three of the flying beasts (50) were big enough to pick up one of the guests, and that each one picked up one person (50 in 21,216 – **1 in 424**).\r\n\r\n4. The majority of the guests had been pushed into the front area of the park. It is a very large area and I’m guessing half of the people were close to the massive lagoon that housed the Mosasaurus. **(1 in 2).**\r\n\r\n5. If a large Pterosaur attacked you, the odds of it flying off with you alive or able to fight would be about **1 in 2.** I gave it those odds because there is an instance where the large flying beast landed on a guy and seemed to be destroying him on the ground.\r\n\r\n6. After being grabbed by a Pterosaur, the odds of you fighting back would be 1 **in 2.**\r\n\r\n7. If you were picked up close to the water you’d have a **1 in 2** chance of being dropped into the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pragmatic odds of being at Jurassic World during a mass animal escape in which you are picked up by a Pterosaur and dropped into a Mosasaurus tank is **1 in 24,761,600 (3,650 x 424 x 16).** There had never been a large scale dinosaur escape in the 10 years the park had been open and nobody had ever been dropped into a large lagoon by a Pterosaur. Also, being that there are 20,000+ people, the odds of being singled out by the 50 attacking Pterosaurs was very slight. Also, I feel terrible for her because she ended up dead because she had to watch two punks while people willingly let out a dinosaur that had active camouflage.\r\n\r\n**Here is what lead Zara to her death.**\r\n\r\n1. She is forced to look after her bosses nephews because their parents are getting a divorce (She’s British…she will be great).\r\n2. The nephews promptly run away from her leaving stressed out, worried and still having to do her day job.\r\n3. Due to some very bad decisions, the Indomnius Rex is let out of its cage.\r\n4. The nephews decide to ignore park warnings and stay out in the park in the moving bubble thing.\r\n5. The Indomnius Rex is chased into a massive aviary holding very hungry flying creatures. The people in the helicopter essentially chased it into the aviary……\r\n6. The nephews hotwire a car and drive back into the park via the west gate.\r\n7. Zara collects the kids, and they run away from her which forces her to chase them.\r\n8. The nephews stop in the middle of the carnage and Zara turns to see what they are doing.\r\n9. A massive pterosaur picks her up and flies away with her.\r\n10.Another pterosaur steals her away and flies toward the lagoon.\r\n11. Poor Zara is dropped into the lagoon.\r\n12. Pterosaurs dive into the water and one of them managed to lift her out of the water.\r\n13. A Mosasaurus eats both Zara and the bird.\r\n14. None of the main characters care.\r\n15. I hope her fiance and parents get a massive settlement.\r\n\r\nConclusion - I feel terrible for Zara. \r\n\r\nIf you liked this dumb data make sure to check out my other dumb data posts on Reddit!

Possibly the worst movie of all time','I don’t know why I watched this. I really really regret it. Here’s a review/synopsis. Save yourself the hour and 40 minutes \r\n\r\nOk, first off, this movie starts right out with a college party scene, that somehow has about 40(ish) extremely hot and just completely naked girls just dancing around and making out with any guy possible. This just flat out doesn’t fucking happen. Granted, I was never involved in Greek life and I have only been to a handful of frat parties, but there’s absolutely no way this goes on at every party. I don’t know. Fuck. Ok. There’s this shitty monologue that starts playing where some dude is like “Ever since I was a kid, I had dreamed about being a frat star at Mason Dixon University.” Where the fuck do I start for this line? When this guy was 8 years old, he dreamed of binge drinking and fucking every girl that comes his way? No, he fucking didn’t. He was 8. Also, “Mason Dixon University” ??? Cool, lets just make the school ambiguously somewhere in the south and definitely a little racist. Jesus. \r\n\r\nOk, the main dude with the monologue, his name is Charlie. First off, Charlie is 30. Straight up 30 years old. There’s no fucking way this guy looks like he’s in college at all, and the first scene they show him in? He’s a freshman getting hazed. He literally looks 10 years older than the guys hazing him. The hazing scene is really stupid. But pales in comparison to the rest of the movie. They’re sitting in buckets of ice cold water while the other frat guys are screaming at them and calling them pussies. Seems realistic so far I guess. I don’t know. They keep saying that “brother” shit that really annoys me. They’re like “Come on guys, brothers for life, we got you” and they make some sort of weird sacrifice for another pledge who is struggling to stay in the water. This pledge is named “douche”, that’s just his name for the rest of the movie. \r\n\r\nOnce they get past the hazing scene, there’s this party scene where they’re all accepting their bids and shit. There’s a fucking concert at this party and it’s apparently got 700 people at it. What really makes me mad about the party scenes is the fucking music they play. This movie must’ve not had a budget for using real music, because they use these songs that are like royalty free frat party music. They literally have choruses that go like “We’re gonna drink all night, cause that’s what frat stars do” These songs made me so fucking angry. Who decided to make these songs??? Could they literally not afford to put one REAL song on their movie? Not even that shitty Sammy Adams “All Night Longer” song that all frat guys love? Ok, back to the party scene. Our main man Charlie and “Douche” have another friend named Billy, who is literally the worst person I’ve ever witnessed in my entire life, fictional or non-fictional. The three amigos make their way to the backyard, but not before Billy, after being rejected by a girl who looks like she is straight out of a Maxim Cover, just fucking pours beer on shirt, exposing her breasts. First sexual assault of the movie? Check. His friends laugh and act like nothing illegal just happened. Ok, then they make it to the backyard. There’s an older frat guy on the stage who is calling Charlie up to the stage because I guess Charlie is gonna set off some fireworks. Terrible fucking idea. Charlie makes his way to the stage but then 2 naked girls distract him and his 2 friends, and they literally act like they have never seen boobs before. They stare at these boobs for like 10 minutes and the guy on stage grows more and more impatient. They finally make it to the stage, and what do you think happens? The fireworks completely fuck everything up. The house is now on fire, shit is burning everywhere, and people are running. Charlie has just committed a ton of crimes. He should at least maybe, I don’t know, go to court? No? His only punishment is getting his frat charter revoked? Amazing justice. \r\n\r\nFlash-forward to 3 years later, Charlie, looking the exact fucking same, is now an RA, and acts like it’s the worst thing anyone can be. He watches some rival frat, I don’t even remember their name, we’ll call them Kappa(?), try and recruit some new members. All of the sudden, some kid who is dressed like a terrible halloween costume of a “nerd” comes up to Charlie and says “I’d love to be in a frat”. Then comes possibly the cringiest line of the entire movie, and maybe of any movie ever. Charlie responds to this kid and says “It’s not a frat, it’s a fraternity. You wouldn’t call your country a cunt would you?” Jesus christ. I had to pause the movie at this point. I stood up and walked away. I didn’t think I’d be able to finish. That logic makes NO FUCKING SENSE. Yeah, you’re right Charlie, you wouldn’t call a country a “cunt”, you know why? Cunt is a derogatory swear word. Frat is not. Also, frat is a commonly used term, some words have abbreviations, some don’t. Jesus CHRIST. AHHH. Ok, anyways, Charlie has this fucking idea where he’s like “I’m gonna go to the old frat house and get drunk by myself in a chair.” By the way, Charlie is totally an alcoholic, which probably just isn’t something to joke about. So he gets drunk in a chair, and these rival frat guys tie him up (?) and then say they’re gonna do something really bad to him (they tape a dildo to his forehead). Charlie ends up finding some old book while he’s in the house that has some old clause from the 1800s that says he can get his frat back if he challenges another frat to a duel and then wins the duel. First off, fuck no. What a stupid plot device. This made me angry. But anyway, he goes to the Dean, who is Tom fucking Green for some reason, and the dean confirms this clause is real. So Charlie challenges the rival frat to a fencing competition because the Billy kid is a champion fencer who apparently lost his testicle in a fencing competition when he was younger in a weird flashback scene that absolutely should not have been in the movie. They win the fencing thing of course and get their frat back, but only if they get 15 pledges and keep the school in a positive light.\r\n\r\nCharlie, Billy and “Douche” throw a party to try and get some pledges, and they claim that a lot of people will come because they used to have the best party. Do they not remember that they got kicked off 3 years ago so NO ONE WILL FUCKING REMEMBER BECAUSE NO ONE WAS AT THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME. Their party sucks at first, they yell at some nerds for eating too much chip dip (why even have the dip then, assholes) and then the nerd from the RA scene comes back and his name is Jonesy. Billy immediately yells at him and calls him some really mean shit for no reason, and Jonesy then brings in 30 INCREDIBLY hot girls out of nowhere and now the frat accepts him. Apparently, Jonesy does medical research on making girls squirt, and there’s a scene where a girl squirts 50 yards across the room into the characters faces. I’m not even gonna go into that. I don’t have the energy. \r\n\r\nThe frat gains some momentum after this party and they find enough recruits, but then the rival frat Kappas steal half their recruits by offering them sports cars and more hot women. The rival frat by the way, has absolutely no reason to hate this other frat, but they do, because you know, it’s a shitty college movie. The two frats declare war on each other and they yell across the street stupid shit at each other all the time. Shit like “You’re a load that your mom should have swallowed and believe me she knows how to swallow” You know, shit a 14 year old thinks is hilarious. This ensues for a little bit, and the main frat is desperate to find some new pledges. They ask the lacrosse team who reluctantly decides to go to a party and they end up having a great time at the party. Then, Charlie, being the fucking idiot he is, challenges the lacrosse guys to a game of flip cup, but instead of cups, it’s buckets of beer. If the frat wins, the lacrosse players have to join, if not, they can go home. Stupid fucking challenge. They were already going to join. They play the game, but since they play with huge ass buckets, they just spill half of it all over each other, so it’s just a shitshow and definitely not a real game that has any merit whatsoever. The frat wins, the guys high five a lot. By the way, there are “Reagan Bush 84” tank tops everywhere. Fuck!!! I’m angry. \r\n\r\nIt looks like the frat is gonna be back on campus!! They throw a party to celebrate. At the party, a girl shoots 3 ping pong balls out of her vagina, 20 feet, and bounces them all into cups on the table in a game of pong. The people high five like they didn’t just witness fucking witchcraft and instead was just a crazy party feat. Yes, that’s a real scene from a real movie. It happens. Anyways, the frat is back! Just kidding, Charlie gets literally DRUGGED AND RAPED by a girlfriend of the rival frat and she films the whole thing and sends it to the whole school. The Dean is pissed because in the video she makes him say that the Dean has a small dick, so the Dean has the emotional capacities of a 16 year old. The frat is banned from campus now. Charlie FINDS OUT he was raped, but instead of pursuing, you know, charges against the girl who rapes him, he goes and tells his boys that he can get their frat back on campus. \r\n\r\nThis next scene was one of the worst. Charlie’s boys are now sitting dejectedly at a table at the student center. Billy, who has sexually assaulted a couple people throughout the movie, goes on a rant about how they are now sitting with the “losers, stoners, and fucking Asians” on campus and are not cool anymore. Casual racism! Nice. Good time to point out by the way, those Asians that get racially harassed, they’re literally the only people of color in the ENTIRE MOVIE. That shouldn’t be surprising I guess though since the movie is called “Total Frat Movie”. \r\n\r\nCharlie heads to the rival frat with proof he was raped, but they just keep saying “Set up” instead of raped because I guess rape and sexual assault just don’t exist in this movie. The Dean is there too for some reason. The rival frat leader gets found out that he helped conspire with the rape and he runs inside and Charlie pursues him. They end up shooting each other with nail guns (felonious assault) and then they throw each other out a fucking 2 story window through glass. Dead? They absolutely should be. Zero injuries at all? Yup, that’s what happens. No one even has a scratch. Then Billy sexually assaults another woman by pouring beer all over her shirt again and some really old dude (presumably the president) in a suit laughs and puts his arm around Billy. Sexual assault is funny and ok! The movie ends with Charlie saying “That’s life when you’re a motherfucking frat star”.

It’s actually kind of ridiculous. Let’s take a minute just to think about the plots of both.\r\n\r\nFor SC3: Santa, our protagonist, has exciting things happening, a big day is coming with lots of family and friends involved, then things go horribly awry and cause him to accidentally lash out at those he loves, a moment he regrets that succeeds only in making him angrier and makes him wish he “had never been Santa at all.” The previously introduced Jack Frost, otherwise known as our antagonist, exploits his anger to get something out of him that he wants; to be Santa Claus. Frost tricks Santa into saying that he’d never been Santa at all and uses a magic snow globe to make that wish come true, resulting in the events of the first movie to play out again, only this time with Frost there to knock Santa down and take up the mantle himself. This results in the entire future of the former Santa (from this point on we’ll just refer to him as Tim Allen or Allen) being changed in such a way as though he was never Santa and just lived a miserable, lonely, sad life, thus making him understand that what he had was amazing and he took it all for granted. He wanders through and through to find those who had integral roles in his life as Santa and tries to convince them of what happened, only to be sneered at as though he’s crazy. He soon finds that the North Pole he once lived in has been completely changed by Frost into an exploitation of money and greed with an amusement park. Tim Allen despises this and goes after Frost to get things changed back to the way they once were and sneakily convinces a little girl from his life as Santa to sneak into the snow globe room and retrieve the magic globe that can grant the wish. Allen causes a distraction so the girl can retrieve the globe and Frost is doing his very best to stop it, unknowing of the plot to get the globe. Allen (after this we’ll start calling him Santa again) ends up succeeding in his quest and tricks Frost into saying those famous words that screwed things up to begin with and uses the snow globe and a recording of him saying the words to go back in time once again. This time, he knocks Frost out of the way, lets the scene play out exactly as it did in the first movie, and time jump s forward once again with everything back the way it was at the beginning of the film. Once Santa returns to his regular life, he has a newfound love and appreciation for everyone in his life and the movie ends with the bad day he was having finishing out nicely with Santa living his life much happier and his Ms. Claus’ baby being delivered. \r\n\r\nSo keep that in mind as next we break down the plot of Shrek 4. Here we go!\r\n\r\nFor Shrek 4: Shrek, our protagonist, starts out his day excited for what’s to come, is ready to have a fantastic birthday party with his friends and family, only to have things go awry yet again with people “ruining” the party and angering Shrek. Thus comes the ever famous “do the roar” scene, leading up to the lashing out at those he loves and the day being ruined. Shrek leaves and meets Rumplestiltskin, our antagonist, who greedily takes advantage of Shrek’s anger to get him to sign a contract that changes time to a point in which the world was almost exactly as it was before the events of even the first movie in the series, with Shrek all alone in peace and quiet in his swamp.  Shrek is happy with this at first, then over time begins to realize just how well off he had it and goes to find those he loved. Of course, none of them know who Shrek is at this point because they’d never met, and think he’s crazy when he tells them he knows them and tries to get them to remember what he remembers. He does his best to get things to the way they once were, but is unsuccessful, and by a tribe of ogres including his former wife Fiona (who also thinks he’s crazy), learns that the land is ruled by Rumplestiltskin and they have to stay militarized to fight back forces of Rumple. Shrek ends up gathering his former friends and family and makes new ones to lead a charge on Rumple’s castle and fights his way to Rumple and gets the contract voided and gets things changed back to the way they were at the beginning of the film. With this, Shrek has a newfound appreciation and love for everyone at the party, despite their flaws, and the movie ends on the happy note of things being all well again in the world.\r\n\r\nSo after having read that, do you see the similarities? How the two movies are almost exactly the same down to a wire? It’s crazy right? Our protagonist has a special day going on that goes bad, causing them to be angry and a spry little greedy elf-like antagonist takes advantage of the protagonist’s anger and uses magic and the will of our protagonist to alter time that also keys into the antagonist’s favor. After time is altered, our protagonist realizes how well he had it and how awful he was to those he loves, and does his best to find them and convince them of what’s happened. They think he’s crazy and send him away, but the protagonist doesn’t give up and convinces at least one of them that he previously knew to help him and invades the place in which the antagonist lives in riches and pulls a trick on the antagonist to change things back to the way they were at the start of the film. When time is back to normal, our protagonist has a new love and appreciation for his loved ones and finishes out the day, despite its flaws, in happiness and appreciation, and this is where the film ends.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think of this?

The film IMO is excellent. I\'ve been a fan of Alex\'s since I first read The Beach back in \'99 (the book is WAY better than the film).\r\n\r\nI liked Ex Machina a lot but wasn\'t quite AS blown away by it as some people.\r\n\r\nAnnihilation is a far more ambitious, audacious, challenging, complex, intelligent, intense piece of work than I think anything he\'s done cinematically either as a writer or director.\r\n\r\nIt played to a sold-out screening at the TIFF Theatre tonight in Toronto, he was there doing a very honest and candid Q&A with the audience after blowing our minds with the film.\r\n\r\nIt is SUCH a visually striking film in so many moments. I really advise against seeing a trailer and if you\'re able to see it in a country that is playing it in theatres - go in fresh. Trailer reveals a bit too much. \r\n\r\nI don\'t want to give away spoilers but there were parts of the film that reminded me of The Fountain, Avatar, Enter the Void, Arrival, Goonies, Alien.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a really well done piece of sci-fi. It bums me out that another boundary pushing piece of work like Bladerunner 2049 won\'t see a bigger theatrical audience since Netflix has rights to it in some major markets. I watch a lot of media on my phone or tablet - don\'t watch this on a small screen half distracted. Find a big screen, sit down and plug in.\r\n\r\nThe only flaws were sometimes you have to suspend disbelief a bit too much in a bit of a convoluted way that reminded me of Interstellar, The Fountain or even Mother. It\'s definitely a bit flawed, more flawed in some ways than Ex Machina but nothing in a way that made me either A: regret seeing it in a theatre or B: think the studio makes a good argument in giving the rights to Netflix. I can\'t imagine the audiences who went to see Arrival, Bladerunner 2049 or Ex Machina strongly disliking this film. \r\n\r\nI\'m also not a huge fan of Natalie Portman but she was fantastic in this. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I dug it.

I believe a few more should have been nominated, including:\r\n\r\nToy Story: I wouldn\'t say that this is my personal favorite, but this movie definitely paved the way for all CGI movies. This was a breakthrough in filmmaking and animation.\r\n\r\nWALL-E: This is a gorgeous movie and probably the most visually appealing animated movie I\'ve ever seen. This was nominated for six Oscars, but none for Best Picture or Director.\r\n\r\nInside Out: This movie was great and I thought it was quite moving. The concept behind this movie was quite unique and was executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nSpirited Away: One of my favorite anime movies. I liked the movie characters and they were quite relatable, especially with Chihiro. I think this movie was colorfully animated. I\'m glad it won Best Animated Feature and no other movie was deserving of that award than this movie.\r\n\r\nPrincess Mononoke: I say this is an oddball choice, but this is a truly good movie. This was a very underrated movie in the West when it was first released. This movie dealt with themes like environmentalism and industrialization as well as sexuality and disability, as seen in Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi. This wasn\'t a typical Disney movie where all the characters are whimsical and whatnot. Miyazaki did a great job of covering these societal issues in this movie.

The first 5/10 minutes are kind of weird, with the angels and thing, but the simplicity that comes from the narrator being a child is perfect, it wonderfully starts the movie, and it starts the plot, which gets more and more complex has the movie continues, in a simple way, as life is seen from a child’s point of view, with very simple facts about life, but after that, as we get into the actual storytelling of all of Nemo’s lives, the movie gets more grounded in reality and more complex, and that makes it amazing, because the plot, with all of it’s changing of characters and places and personalities, is just complex enough to understand the first time you watch it, but complex enough so that piecing it apart is incredibly satisfying and makes you want to see the movie more and more. As I said earlier, the plot starts simple and get’s more  and more complex as the movie goes, it starts from one life, to two, to three, to four, and then to five, and keeping track of all those four different stories would be incredibly disorienting if two things were not done : first, the different appearances of Nemo can make the viewer instantly know which life we are following, but even that wouldn’t be enough if the different timelines were introduced all at once, but the gradual increase in the complexity of the storytelling makes it all easily understandable, the movie literally starts by a child talking to us about how it is to be a child, and ends with a theory of the future of the universe wich isn’t proven yet, if it even will happen. Then, we have the actual different stories from the different lives, the one with Anna is basically a romantic comedy, the one with Elise is more like a dramatic movie, and the one with Jeanne is an adventure movie, because, you have a man, Nemo, who has a really good life he has a lot of money, his wife loves him, and he got everything he promised himself he’d get, but he gets bored of it, and, breaking the first promise he made to himself, lets all of his decisions be decided by chance, and goes on a (short) adventure. The life with Elise is a drama, she gets depressed and they cry together and more stuff happens, finally, the story with Anna simply is a classic love movie, they love each other, but are forced to be separated by forces outside of them, and after loosing each other for many years, but without loosing the faith they had that they would one day find the other, and the acting makes those scenes incredibly sad.( but maybe that impression is just because I am  just some random teen who’s biggest fear is to not feel true love in my life, so take that point with a grain of sand) Finally, all of that is packed in some amazingly well done pacing, music, acting and visuals.

It’s only the 4th movie ever to score a second weekend with over $100M. The $111M for the weekend makes it the second highest second weekend ever, only trailing The Force Awakens’ $149M. It also pushes the movie over $400M domestically, third fastest to that mark behind only TFA and Jurassic World. The numbers for this movie are just ridiculous. The 44% dropped from week to week helped in this regard. Now holds the record for second-week-grosser by the MCU, doing better than the original Avengers movies.\r\n\r\n**Black Panther (cont):** Internationally this movie couldn’t be stopped either adding another $83M, to top the $700M mark. It is now in 10th place among MCU movies internationally, topping in Australia, Germany, West Africa (since when do we talk about West Africa B.O. returns?) that’s how crazy this has been. \r\n\r\n**Game Night:** The latest Jason Bateman movie worked very well for counter programming on this weekend earning $17M for the R Rated vehicle. On a weekend of winner and losers, Warner Bros. should count themselves lucky. The director is even talking about the possibilities of sequels but let’s not get ahead of ourselves yet. When compared to other movies that fit these criteria (Horrible Bosses, Office Christmas Party or Bad Moms) is on the lower end of success.\r\n\r\n**Annihilation:** When you have a Director coming up from the high of Ex Machina, a great actress in Natalie Portman this is not the kind of news you want to make. With a disappointing $11M, this movie faltered in many ways. While critics seemed to love it, the audiences didn’t connect with this movie at all, with a Cinemascore of C. With only Arrival as the only good news in this genre in the last few years it will be interesting to see how Sci-Fi can generate interest in the general public. Annihilation has a very tough road ahead since there really won’t be an international income. Netflix has those rights in just a few weeks. Paramount saw the writing on the wall and sold the rights to Netflix as they did with The Cloverfield Paradox.\r\n\r\n**Every Day:** I had to look up the trailer for this movie, since I never heard of this movie before today.

What were your 10-ish favorite movies that came out in theaters near you in 2017? \r\n\r\nLet\'s keep it civil, too. The idea of these kinds of threads is to celebrate the movies we enjoyed the most from this year, not to insult each other\'s movie preferences. (No one wants to hear your 5,000 word thesis on why The Last Jedi is the worst movie of all time)\r\n\r\nTo start off, mine were:\r\n\r\n10) **Colossal** - Giant Kaiju film about digging yourself out of a depression hole sounds like a weird premise for a movie, but it really works, thanks in large part to some really subtle acting from Jason Sudeikis.\r\n\r\n9) **Blade Runner 2049** - This movie is fucking gorgeous, and was probably the best visual storyteller of 2017.\r\n\r\n8) **Lady Bird** - This movie was a lot of fun. It was just a lot of smart characters cracking wise at each other for about 90 minutes, but I also really liked the development those characters got.\r\n\r\n7) **John Wick: Chapter 2** - This had some of the most creative action scenes of the year, and it looked and sounded great, too.\r\n\r\n6) **mother!** - I don\'t think mother! is quite as clever at symbolism and allegory as it thinks it is, but I still had a blast going on Mr. Aronofsky\'s wild ride.\r\n\r\n5) **A Silent Voice** - I dare you to watch this movie and not tear up by the end.\r\n\r\n4) **Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri** - The plot isn\'t that great, but the performances by the main cast are so good, I didn\'t really mind that so much.\r\n\r\n3) **Baby Driver** - Edgar Wright is a genius, and I will slavishly devote myself to everything he puts out.\r\n\r\n2) **Get Out** - How the hell is this Jordan Peele\'s first directing gig?\r\n\r\n1) **Star Wars: The Last Jedi** - I\'m a bit of a Star Wars apologist, but I do actually think The Last Jedi is the best movie I saw from last year. It looked great, sounded great, had great acting, action, and the story felt very satisfying by itself while also acting as a bridge between the other two movies in a trilogy.','It: Chapter Two',152,297,'2018-02-28 11:49:19'),('811cp9','\'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\': Tarantino\'s Latest Gets Leo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt','','Once Upon a Time in Hollywood',13981,1325,'2018-02-28 20:04:08'),('81416o','What are some \'coming of age\' movies with an intelligent protagonist, such as Good Will Hunting and Catch Me If You Can?','I really enjoy watching movies with characters who are incredibly intelligent and don\'t necessarily know what to do with it.

There is like hundreds of bad guys trying to kill them, and he fights them all off until he gets shot in his eyes.

He grabs an oversized wrench and again goes outside without a suit or tether.\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone’s waiting at the pods for Vin Diesel but he isn’t coming. The Rock forces everyone into the escape pods, hesitated and then hits eject. Tyrese looks hella sad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVin Diesel is wrenching at the space station core to try and stabilize it and prevent a dark matter explosion. The wrench breaks and he’s beating it with his hands as he watches the escape pod get a way. He starts to lose consciousness and drifts away from the station.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s two bright lights like the headlights on a 1995 Mitsubishi eclipse a figure blocks out the light as they dives towards them.

Why? What am I missing?','I love movies.\r\n\r\nThe first distinct memory I have of watching a movie - I know that I must have watched movies before this, but I don’t remember them - is December of 1999. I was four years old, sitting on the floor of my living room in front of my tiny box set, when the words “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away….” appeared on the screen. It was Star Wars. Yellow words, stars, a pan down, a moon that looked like ours, then suddenly another moon, and then a giant planet that looked like sand. A big, big ship. Something’s shooting at it. Then a ship appears, so monstrous it made the big ship look like a Mini Cooper in comparison, so impossibly huge that it was in three corners of the screen at once. That shot, that moment, changed my life forever. In fact, I think it’s nearly my first memory. The only thing I know for sure happened before that was that I fell down the stairs of my basement once when I was three.\r\n\r\nIn nearly 20 years since, I have seen somewhere in the neighbourhood of 4,000 films. That’s a little bit less than half the number of days I’ve been alive. I go to the theater 15-20 times a year. About half those times I will be seeing just one movie. Others I will see two or three. This past Boxing Day, I saw five films in the span of 12 hours. I don’t go to see every film that comes out, as I do have to have some level of interest - a relatively easy thing to do as my tastes are massively varied - in order to dedicate my two hours to something. I don’t think I could compare myself to someone like Ebert, who probably easily saw 100+ movies every year whether he was interested in every one or not. But I have still seen probably more films than most people see in two lifetimes.\r\n\r\n2017 is, to me, one of cinema’s absolute landmark years the way something like 1974 is. Of my all-time top 100 films, which is out of thousands, 2017 currently owns ten of those spots, including #2 (Blade Runner 2049). I adore so many of the films that came out in the last 12 months. There are films like the aforementioned 2049, Logan, Lady Bird, Call Me by Your Name, Dunkirk, even The Post; which have all unlocked new things for me as a filmgoer and a lover of talking about cinema.\r\n\r\nSo, enter The Florida Project. I hated that I missed this one in theaters. I got earfuls from people about needing to see it. It was in EVERY. SINGLE. TOP. TEN. LIST. It was by all accounts one of THE essential films from an essential year. Plus it apparently had career-best work from one of my favourite actors who has ever lived. I finally watched it the other night. I was so goddamn excited to cross off one of my final 2017 films, the one on the top of my list. And with all that said and done…\r\n\r\nI hated it.\r\n\r\nNo, seriously, I despise this movie. It completely blows my mind how terrible it is, and the overwhelming positive reception as if this film is the Citizen Kane of the 21st century is the most confusing thing ever to me. I have hated movies before. I have seen lots of terrible movies that made me feel robbed of my time. I have certainly seen films that are cinematic sewage, that have no writing or characters or story or direction or acting or quality. The Florida Project might technically be better than, say, Sharknado, but despite that - hell, despite the fact that the movie even has a wealth of good in it - I think it’s the worst movie I’ve ever seen if my metric for ranking films is a cross between judged cinematic worth and how little the movie made me feel like my time was wasted.\r\n\r\nBut let’s get into the positives first before I talk about the things that detonated this film for me.\r\n\r\nIt does absolutely no fucking around in telling us who its’ characters are. All the kids, Grandma, Halley, Ashley, Bobby… their first scenes all without question tell us who these people are and how they will behave for the next hour and a half. I will always respect a screenplay that does that.\r\n\r\nThere’s gold in the dialogue. The “this is my favourite tree” line that has been discussed a billion times deserves every bit of praise. The cinematography is similarly pretty much uniformly brilliant - there are some fucking WONDERFUL shots in this film - up until a certain point that I’m going to talk about when I get to the negatives. I think my favourite moment visually was when Bobby lit his cigarette at the same moment the hotel lights came on. I don’t often care for symbolism but the parallel that this man is a beacon of light for this building and its’ residents was great.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Bobby, Dafoe is BY FAR the greatest thing about this film. There’s a phenomenal short feature hidden inside this movie if you take ONLY the scenes that have Willem Dafoe in them. The drama between him and Caleb Landry Jones is amazing, but is damaged by the fact that it does nothing to complement the remainder of the film and instead is great only on its’ own terms. He is what kept me watching every time I reached to turn the film off. Him pulverizing the pedophile’s soul is great. Him putting Hallee in her fucking place is fantastic. Him telling his security guy not to let people get run over in the parking lot is legitimately maybe the best moment in the entire film.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the little girl who played Moonee, Brooklynn Prince, is fantastic. It’s incredible that she’s only what, six? She comes across to me like the girl version of myself when I was six, idealistic and happy despite living in a broken world that had already rubbed off on me in the most subtly terrible ways. The scene of her sobbing in front of Jancey is heart-rending and I think it’s fine to consider the Oscars to have snubbed her. Between Millie Bobby Brown, Dafne Keen and now this little girl, we have a trio of VERY young actresses who, if they all continue into adulthood, will create a new dynasty of actresses who will dominate the landscape of cinema.\r\n\r\nAnd finally there are some visual storytelling things that I love. Number one being of course the multiple scenes of Moonee bathing where you slowly key into what’s actually happening each subsequent time.\r\n\r\nSo, the bad? Well… I hate the scene transitions and most of the storytelling. I fucking hate films that are just a random series of vignettes. That’s what I watch documentaries and Koyaanisqatsi for. When I watch a fictional movie I’m here to watch a set of characters progress because of a series of events. Instead what the movie does is begin its’ plot two thirds of the way through and hammer you over the head with how abruptly it happens, and that’s after over an hour of mostly random shit. I really like how the film jump cuts within certain scenes, like how Halley and Bobby are arguing down the walkway but then all of a sudden it cuts and they’ve descended two flights of stairs. It reminds me of Breathless. I just wish the structure of the movie wasn’t handled the same way. In reality what’s the only way you get down a flight of stairs that instantly? By falling down them. That’s what this movie felt like. I know firsthand, remember?\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t know whose story it wants to tell. This movie isn’t Magnolia. It isn’t telling nine stories and then having them interlink in a satisfying, rewarding way at the film’s conclusion. Who is the main character? Oh it’s Moonee? Then why the fuck did Bria Vinaite get half the fucking screentime? Why are multiple scenes devoted to the drama between Bobby and his son as if something will come of it? If this movie is supposed to be about Moonee then it should have been a movie about Moonee. Just because it includes random one-off scenes like her and the kids laughing at the redheaded lady bathing topless does not make it a movie about Moonee.\r\n\r\nThe condo arson really pisses me off. It was presented as the real “kickoff” point of the film only to have no consequences whatsoever. Yeah, it prompts Ashley to be obscure in cutting off Halley, but that to me is bullshit too. And that ties into my next point.\r\n\r\nThe manufactured drama. Even Moonee running away at the end only happens because the child care workers AND police officers AND (maybe) even fucking Bobby act like buffoons. The only reason I’ll let that one slide is because the film avoided the Antoine Fuqua-level cheap drama bullshit cliche where she gets hit by a car or something. Ashley being mysterious towards Hallee about wanting her to stay away from Scooty is probably the biggest example of manufactured tension, but the scene with the Middle Eastern motel owner refusing Bobby’s money just to force Halley to go to Grandma’s place at The Future is worse. As if this woman running a shitty motel in buttfuck nowhere Florida is going to refuse making easy money. Why didn’t the movie just make Grandma’s place the first destination for Halley to go to if only to spare me one less fucking scene of Halley being a whiny bitch.\r\n\r\nThat’s the biggest problem I have with this movie. Halley. Fucking Halley. The story goes that Bria Vinaite was chosen for this film because Sean Baker found her on Instagram. Yeah, I could believe it. If you told me she was plucked off a street corner and then had a camera pointed at her I would believe you. She cannot act. There is nothing natural about her performance. It is stilted and forced and robotic and the worst part is that she acts no different in real life. But whatever. I can get over a bad performance if the writing is strong, which is great because the writing’s strong, right?\r\n\r\nWrong. The writing for Halley is absolute shit. She spends two hours whining and screaming and swearing and being a terrible person and doing reprehensible things, and yet the movie wants you to support her. Sean Baker made this movie through a lens of objectivity? The movie only wants you to observe and then pick your own side? Bullshit. I can practically hear him pleading with me to be compassionate towards Halley. All that was gone by the time the fucking awful diner scene came along. Whatever iota was left evaporated the second she destroyed all that food after having just spent five minutes of the film making a poor waitress (Ashley) feel like garbage at work, pissing away the money she’s supposed to use for rent, just because the waitress decided she didn’t want her son playing with Halley’s daughter anymore.\r\n\r\nAlready I hated this character, not in the way that I hate Nurse Ratched because she’s a brilliant villain, but in the way that I hate Lisa from The Room because she’s a piece of shit who the movie expects me to empathize with. And THEN she stormed into Ashley’s motel room and beat her senseless because of HER OWN CHOICES. I don’t care if she loves Moonee - and does she? Or does she just love the control she has? - or how many times she takes her running out in the rain. She’s a garbage mom and a garbage human. And there’s no payoff to that. We just get to see her be a bitch for the entire runtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, that seems sort of balanced, right? This movie would never have made my top ten for the year or anything, but Halley aside, there are parts of this film, moments, that I loved. And now we get to the ending, which really to me is incredibly ballsy and honestly had nearly fixed this film for me. Bobby hearing the confrontations revolving around Moonee and NOT stepping in, NOT being the savior, NOT doing what every other Hollywood character similar to him has ever done, blew my mind. And Moonee sobbing at her friend’s doorstep, her childhood imploded, is dark, and sad, and true, and brilliant, and beautiful in a horrible way. And then the movie cuts to black, and I’m moved by what just happened.\r\n\r\nExcept that isn’t what happens. No. Instead we get the stupid fucking garbage we get, where suddenly this beautiful 35mm footage turns into a shitty cellphone video and this nonsensical run to and through Disneyland. People can keep arguing all they want that “he filmed all of Tangerine with an iPhone so it’s fine”, except that you’re stupid because TANGERINE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOVIE. And yeah, I get it with the music and the cellphone that everything from the reverse shot of Jancey trembling onwards is a fantasy and inside Moonee’s head and her escape from her now ruined childhood. But the problem is, A: it’s bullshit and B: it doesn’t change anything. Her mother is still a piece of shit, she’s still being taken away, Grandma’s crappy kid has spilt food all over the bed, she’s broken down in tears, and the child care workers will find her in a few minutes and her future is now irreversibly, cataclysmically shifted. The final 60 seconds try to tell you “never mind any of that, here’s Disneyland!” Fuck that.\r\n\r\nWhen the film cut to black, I did a few things simultaneously. I jumped out of my seat. I threw my remote on the ground. I raised my arms in frustration. I screamed at the TV. I booed. Me, alone at 3 AM, in my living room, booed this movie. It offended me. I joke all the time about how Catwoman or Suicide Squad or Battlefield Earth or Freddy Got Fingered are “offensively bad” but this is the first and only time I have sincerely come out the other side of any film offended by its’ existence.\r\n\r\nBut I’m far more bothered by the disconnect between me and apparently every single other person who has seen The Florida Project than I could ever be by the film itself.\r\n\r\nWhy don’t I get this movie? What am I missing? Why am I seemingly the only person in the world who absolutely hated, hated, hated, hated The Florida Project? It has been three days since I watched it, and it is bothering me. It has been affecting my sleep. I haven’t been functioning at work. I have cried six different times thinking about it. The fact that I hate this movie makes me feel more alone, more of an outsider, than either my breakup or my social disorder ever have. I very sincerely despised this movie. It is not the first and already since is not the last time that has happened with a film for me, yet for some reason I am depressed about the fact that I hate this movie and yet no one else does.\r\n\r\nSo please help me. Help me understand why I should think this movie is the best drama since Schindler’s List. Or if I’m not wrong and you agree with me, please introduce yourself. Because for whatever reason, this film is tearing me apart. Not with desire to reevaluate the film, but with worry that I have shifted universes.','Escape Room',0,82,'2018-03-09 23:50:51'),('83fl0l','Robert Rodriguez Welcomes SXSW To ‘Alita: Battle Angel’ Set; Cast Explains How The Sci-Fi Movie Empowers Women','','Alita: Battle Angel',0,3,'2018-03-10 09:54:30'),('83grnp','\'Deadpool 2\'s Zazie Beetz Has Signed A Three Film Deal With Fox','','Domino',1640,285,'2018-03-10 13:01:12'),('83iy60','\'Hellboy\' Creator Mike Mignola Says the New Movie is Loyal to the Comics','','Hellboy',878,158,'2018-03-10 18:36:05'),('83ndkg','Not-so-popular - psychological thrillers/movies with ambiguous endings/mindf**k movies','* A tale of 2 sisters\r\n* Memories of murder\r\n* Dark city 1998\r\n* I origins\r\n* Spoorloos 1988\r\n* Cache 2005\r\n* The orphanage\r\n*After hours\r\n* Confessions 2010\r\n* Frailty\r\n* Frequency\r\n* Spider 2002\r\n* Take shelter\r\n* Babadook\r\n* The lobster\r\n* The gift\r\n* The body aka El Cuerpo\r\n* The crying game\r\n* Soylent Green\r\n* Tape 2001 \r\n* The cure 1997\r\n* Trance\r\n* We need to talk about kevin\r\n* Rangitaranga\r\n* Pan\'s Labyrinth\r\n* Planet of apes 1968\r\n* Montage\r\n* MatchStick Men\r\n* Contact 1997\r\n* Cypher 2002\r\n* Fallen 1998\r\n* Incendies\r\n* Inherent vice\r\n* Enter the void\r\n* Irreversible 2002\r\n* Lost highway\r\n* blue velvet\r\n* Serenity 2005\r\n* Another earth\r\n* The others\r\n* Stalker 1979\r\n* No smoking\r\n* The tree of life \r\n* Uncle boonmee who can recall his past lives\r\n* 1984\r\n* Inland empire\r\n* detachment\r\n* existenz\r\n* funny games\r\n* a pure formality\r\n* the skeleton key\r\n* jacob\'s ladder\r\n* Thelma 2017\r\n* the skin I live in\r\n* the ninth gate\r\n* the invisible guest\r\n* the handsmaiden\r\n* montage\r\n* Mother 2017\r\n* Audition 1999\r\n* the village 2004\r\n* perfect blue 1997\r\n* Inland empire\r\n* ghost in the shell 1995\r\n* angel heart 1987\r\n* cypher 2002\r\n* fallen 1998\r\n* dogtooth\r\n* dogville\r\n* brazil\r\n* stoker\r\n* Mr brooks\r\n* The thing\r\n* sinister\r\n\r\nThat\'s about all I can find in my drive right now.\r\nI haven\'t mentioned movies like triangle.coherence,primer,interstellar,inception,shutter island etc..cuz everyone has already watched it(I find these movies on every mind bending movies posts).\r\nSo if you have any movies in similar to these in your mind,which you think are not popular ,please comment I will add them.','Angel Has Fallen',7,13,'2018-03-11 11:34:02'),('83ngl0','Crew Member Electrocuted on Set of Netflix\'s Motley Crue Biopic \'The Dirt\'','','The Dirt',196,50,'2018-03-11 11:48:11'),('83r6d0','Taron Egerton To Play Elton John in Upcoming Biopic \'The Rocketman\'','','Rocketman',934,83,'2018-03-11 21:02:18'),('83rf7c','What are some movie scenes I can recreate with rubber ducks?','Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, but what are some iconic (easily recognizable) movie scenes that could be reasonably easily recreated with rubber ducks?

I felt like I was a fly in someone else’s house, and the details and acting made me feel I really got to know these real people. \r\n\r\nI thought it was very sweet in the beginning when Woodcock describes his love for his mother and then it became apparent he’s almost like a literal child with the whining if anything, ANYTHING at all is not how he wants it to be. A brat. It’s like this adult looking man who’s an actual child. And then it’s all apparent at the end. Freudian.\r\n\r\nThen I was thinking how the movie perfectly captures that surrender when you’re in relationship with someone. You’re no longer in control. You change your diet. Daily routine. Habits. Even how you talk. You have to deal with their annoying traits and you’ll never ever experience peace and quiet that you had before again. You can’t have both love and that.

Dowd](https://www.avclub.com/turns-out-that-a-boring-tomb-raider-movie-might-be-wors-1823772814)\r\n\r\n> *...this Tomb Raider is a competently staged origin-story reboot, grounding the character’s globe-trotting, puzzle-solving adventures in something like a physical and even emotional reality. What’s missing, quite critically, is the sense that anyone involved saw more than a renewable franchise and milkable intellectual property in the exploits of an X-treme spelunker. When it comes to what should be the reliably dumb fun of tomb raiding, maybe there are worse crimes than insulting viewers’ intelligence or bombarding them with crappy special effects. Boring them? Now that’s a felony offense.* **C**\r\n\r\n[The Chicago Tribune - Michael Phillips](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-tomb-raider-review-0314-story.html)\r\n\r\n> *The Lara Croft reboot “Tomb Raider” isn’t half bad for an hour. Then there’s another hour. That hour is quite bad. It’s no fun watching your action heroine get shoved, punched and kicked to the sidelines of her own movie, while the menfolk take over and take turns overacting before expiring.* **2/5**\r\n\r\n[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/tomb-raider/review/)\r\n\r\n> *And in its desperation to maintain a relentless pace, even mundane events such as a bicycle race are recalibrated into pulsating action sequences. It’s 90 per cent dramatic peril, and competently shot, but it leaves the dialogue scenes feeling suspiciously similar to video game cutscenes.* **2/5**\r\n\r\n[Entertainment Weekly - Leah Greenblatt](http://ew.com/movies/2018/03/14/tomb-raider-review/)\r\n\r\n>*The latest big-screen iteration of the blockbuster video game isn’t a film for the ages, but it’s actually pretty good fun; an old-fashioned treasure-island adventure tale gilded in circa-2018 wokeness (Lara Croft’s breasts no longer command a lead supporting role) and anchored by an Oscar-winning actress far more gifted than the story requires.* **B**\r\n\r\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/14/tomb-raider-review-alicia-vikander-dominic-west-lara-croft)\r\n\r\n> *And throughout Vikander maintains a kind of serene evenness of manner. Blandness is Lara’s theme.*\r\n\r\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Todd McCarthy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/tomb-raider-review-1094069)\r\n\r\n> *It\'s a new package for old goods in Tomb Raider, a grimly determined by-the-numbers rehash of the same sort of plots and action moves that animated the first two Lara Croft films back in the early 2000s. Brandishing impressively packed abs and enough upper body strength to pull herself out of countless jams, Alicia Vikander gamely steps into the kick-ass role twice played by Angelina Jolie, but the derivative story and cardboard supporting characters are straight out of 1930s movie serials.*\r\n\r\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/tomb-raider-review-alicia-vikander-video-game-adaptation-reboot-1201938846/)\r\n\r\n>*When “Tomb Raider” digs into its more creative action, including a breathless bike race through London and a genuinely queasy shipwreck, it’s about as entertaining as popcorn entertainment gets these days. It’s when the film falls back on the old tropes that things grind to a halt.* **C+**\r\n\r\n[The Los Angeles Times - Justin Chang](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-tomb-raider-review-20180314-story.html)\r\n\r\n> *It\'s hardly the first or last time Hollywood has plundered one of its own long-dormant properties, but it\'s also a reminder that not every resurrection has to feel like a desecration.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ScreenCrush - Matt Singer](http://screencrush.com/tomb-raider-review-2018/)\r\n\r\n> *To her credit, Vikander works hard and looks the part. She also has some chemistry with Daniel Wu, who plays the guy who helps Lara get to the island and then sort of becomes her sidekick. (Then he says “I’m not leaving Lara behind!” and vanishes completely from the movie for about 30 minutes. Oh well.)

The movie is full of vine-swinging, bow-and-arrow-shooting, ancient-spirit-meeting action, but most of it is staged on a convincing human scale, one that’s been expertly tailored to its star’s understated directness.*\r\n\r\n[The Verge - Scott Tobias](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17119790/tomb-raider-movie-review-2018-alicia-vikander)\r\n\r\n> *The 2018 Tomb Raider does well enough to satisfy a video game and movie franchise simultaneously, but the two aren’t easily reconciled. When Lara is pinned to a stone wall, trying to figure out which colored gem goes into which slot, it can’t help but feel like some offscreen controller is managing her actions.

It\'s insane that they interspersed this script with flying cars and expensive CGI scenes. \r\n\r\nThe disappointing thing is there\'s a hint of skillful filmmaking here, midway through I was starting to care about these characters trapped in this almost inescapable situation, and the latter half of the script just fell flat. Paul Rudd\'s character as a guy desperate to escape should have been the last half.

Lady bird is one of them, and here are the reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, I myself (28 male, Greek) was raised in a small town and had to leave it at 18, so this movie hit home so hard, I was literally sobbing for 2 hours during and after I watched it. \r\n\r\n1) **It was real**. I\'m tired of watching all those feel-good comedy dramas, where there is a happy ending for the viewer and everything is wrapped up. This movie felt like looking through a peephole of a household in Sacramento, all of the characters were 3 dimensional, had their own background and depth. The struggling, yet loving mom, feeling sad for the family\'s financial status and worrying her children might feel ashamed because of it. The emotionally distant dad, that plays solitaire while a huge fight is taking place behind him, who suffers from depression, but gives all he has to his children in the best way he can. The lies Ladybird uses, to seem \'cool\' to her colleagues, seems cheesy, but is quite common in that age. \r\n\r\n2) **It is nostalgic.** It may be even more because I was 15 in 2002, but the core values are the same. The way Gerwig has written the core relationships between mother-daughter, where in one moment they\'re fighting like they\'ll never speak again, and at the same moment they speak about casual things, like which dress to wear at the prom. Also, the way Ladybird is rebellious and trying to question everything that is given to her (basketball court scene about adoption) or religion. I have many more examples, but the feelings were nostalgic, because I remember very distinctly fighting with the same thoughts or seeing parents making selfless efforts to keep you happy, without expecting to hear \'thank you\'. \r\n\r\n3) **Little moments.** It may sound a cliche, but the little moments in this movie take the cake for me, as they\'re so very true, relatable and heart-warming. \r\n\r\n* The scene where Ladybird is crying in the car and her mom doesn\'t know why, but she hugs her and comforts her.\r\n* The scene that she tries to confront her gay ex and he is ending up crying on her shoulder, because it\'s hard for him to come out to his parents.\r\n* When her mom is not speaking to her and she is crying for her attention, but still getting the silent treatment. \r\n* The emotionally shut dad, who never expresses his feelings, but who gets hurt from leaving Ladybird one block away from her school \r\n* The final scene, where she\'s driving for the first time in Sacramento and wants to share this moment with her mom and her mom has already had the exact same thought. This for me captures the spirit of this relationship, the - sometimes - overwhelming struggle of a mom to protect her child and deter her from having the same bad experiences that she had had. \r\n\r\n4) **Performances**. Oh my god, the casting was excellent and the deliveries of Saoirse Ronan(Ladybird), Laurie Metcalf(Mom), Tracy Letts(Dad) are absolutely stunning. Their delivery feels so natural, that it really made me re-watch scenes 2-3 times and admire their geniusness. I\'ve seen Laurie Metcalf in Horace and Pete as well, delivering a mind-blowing monologue. I feel if they were in not such a great movie year (seriously 2018 was an amazing year for movies), they would have gotten both Oscars. \r\n\r\n5) **Aesthetics**. Last but no least, the photography and the location of the movie were stunning to watch, also the colors, the soundtrack was beautiful. Not to mention Saoirse Ronan\'s natural beauty, which Gerwig herself complimented (something in the lines of I\'d prefer to show her face for the whole movie or something) [link to article anyone?]\r\n\r\nSo all in all, if you are someone who enjoys watching action and super-hero movies, probably you didn\'t get the hype behind this masterpiece. If you expected this to be a movie where \'something happens\' and there is start, middle-part, end sequence, you watched the wrong movie. This is a realistic, nostalgic drama, and if you ask me movies should be made more like this, than everyone expecting something to happen or a happy-end or anything. I can\'t wait to see Greta Gerwig\'s next projects.\r\n\r\nIt also reminded me of a saying about standing ovation: When the moment comes for a standing ovation, and you have a doubt about it, whether to stand-up, if you\'ll be the only one standing etc. it\'s not the right moment for it.

But here goes: I love movies that involve or revolve around the lives and work of writers. I thought I\'d give a few recommendations of my own and then ask you all to share your own favorites. Maybe I\'ll do a blog post featuring your recommendations in the future. Anywho:\r\n\r\n**As Good As It Gets** (1997): Jack Nicholson is Melvin, an embittered (and kind of bigoted) writer living with OCD. After his neighbor, a gay artist, is assaulted in a robbery, the two form an unlikely friendship. The film mostly revolves around Melvin\'s offbeat romance with single mom waitress Carol, played by Helen Hunt, but Melvin\'s writer background seeps in at some of the most interesting times. Also, Jack has some of the [best lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNKIjLLZMWs).\r\n\r\n**The Grand Budapest Hotel** (2014): The focus of this movie, really, is on a murder conspiracy between Adrien Brody, Ralph Fiennes, and Tilda Swinton, but it\'s the framing of this story that gives the movie its magic. Jude Law is The Author, a revered novelist in the fictional Eastern European country Zubrowka. In one of his most beloved novels, the titular The Grand Budapest Hotel, he recounts one of his visits to the decaying establishment and his encounter with the aging proprietor. The aspect of this film that most shines to me is his explanation - and the film\'s demonstration - of a writer\'s process of receiving stories. As a writer myself, I do often find that the stories come to me in my everyday life. Writers are observers first, and it is their unique gift and privilege to document the interesting and weird happenings of life in the written form.\r\n\r\n**Moulin Rouge** (2001): Ewan McGregor is Christian, a penniless English writer who has moved to Paris to write about love. Not knowing a thing about love, young and naive Christian has a fortuitous run-in with Toulouse-Lautrec, who takes him to the famed Moulin Rouge to help pitch his idea for a musical. Christian ends up falling for the dancer Satine, and it all goes to hell from there. This was one of the first movies I remember seeing with writing being a prominent element of the film, and it was also used here as a framing device. Even if you\'re not a fan of romance films or musicals, it\'s well-acted and funny.\r\n\r\n**Stranger Than Fiction** (2006): Will Ferrell is Harold, an IRS auditor who realizes one day that he hears his life being narrated in his head. His world is turned upside down when the narration tells him that he is going to die. As it happens, a writer struggling with writer\'s block, Karen, is writing a novel that *is* his life. When the two ultimately meet, Karen must decide whether to spare this poor man, who she had no idea was real, or commit to her art and allow him to die. The writing elements in this film ought to be obvious, but the one that stuck out to me was the writer\'s block. I think a lot of people assume that writer\'s block is simply about running out of ideas or not having ideas for how to proceed; these people have it wrong. *Writer\'s block comes from fear*, whether a fear that what you write will not be good or from a simple fear of the blank page. This fear plagues writers of all walks of life, from amateurs to established authors, and I was pleased to see it acknowledged.\r\n\r\n**Whisper of the Heart** (1995): This is my favorite one from the list and the only animated film from the lot. A Studio Ghibli film not made by a Miyazaki, Whisper of the Heart tells of Shizuku, a junior high school student who loves to read. By chance, she checks out a book borrowed earlier by Seiji, a boy who annoys her. She eventually finds her way to an antique shop run by Seiji\'s grandfather, where her imagination is captured by a cat statuette named the Baron standing in the middle of the shop. The statuette has a counterpart lost in parts unknown, a tragic tale that inspired Shizuku to write a story about the Baron, searching for his lost love Louise. Out of this entire list, I love this movie the most, because Shizuku\'s passion for writing is *the* focus of the film. I love watching her struggle to express herself and to get the words onto the page, to watch her sweat and bleed for her need to unleash something creative into the world. Ultimately, in a way, she succeeded: the movie received a sequel of sorts, The Cat Returns, in 2002.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you all enjoyed this list. Please feel free to post your own favorites/recommendations as well.

The movie is definitely an enjoyable nostalgia trip that never stops impressing.

After this scene, Wade meets real life Artemis (Samantha) and has a casual chat with her, completely forgetting his aunt had just died and he has lost his home. The movie never addresses this which left me confused. The scene itself when his aunt dies didn\'t really have much weight to it either, I felt so disconnected with his aunt as a character that I didn\'t care if she was burned alive.\r\nTo finish, I\'m not saying that Ready Player One is a bad movie, I\'m just saying, I expected more emotional moments from a Steven Spielberg movie, since he is generally really good at that.\r\n\r\n','Bad Trip',5,32,'2018-04-08 06:10:49'),('8aq84p','Just rewatched \'The Iron Giant\', it\'s the hardest I\'ve ever cried in any movie.

The movie is also paced perfectly, no scene is pointless or wasted, and the climax of the film hits exactly where the filmmakers wanted it to. I actually sobbed in one scene, which set off a domino effect, resulting in my girlfriend spilling her tea everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf you haven\'t seen it for a while, or at all for that matter, I suggest you pick up a copy, and give it a watch.

I believe Al Pacino\'s performance in Paterno is one of his best performances in recent times. The soundtrack is brilliant and the plot moves along smoothly without any hitches. I\'d rate the movie a solid 7/10. Spotlight, with a similar premise, was obviously a much better film but this one really does well to capture the atmosphere that surrounded the scandal. Looking at the film OBJECTIVELY, Barry Levinson does a fine job presenting the story centered on Paterno during the aftermath of the Sandusky sex abuse scandal without any major bias. Its to be expected that some who will see this film will simply condemn it or trash it based upon their own emotional or bias connection to the subject matter. I believe that this film does a great job portraying several aspects. One, just how disgusting and awful the actual child sex abuse scandal was and how it even affected the first victim who broke his silence. Then we have initial reporter who helped bring the story to life. Thirdly, the film effectively displays how it affected Paterno and his family in the aftermath. Lastly and most of all how Paterno himself handled the entire situation. If nothing else, this film provides a general condemnation of inaction and corruption with regards to the abuse and not taking quicker action on it.\r\n\r\n','The Aftermath',12,4,'2018-04-10 02:24:41'),('8b81h8','New Poster - David Robert Mitchell\'s \'Under The Silver Lake\' | Andrew Garfield, Riley Keough, Topher Grace','','Under the Silver Lake',1356,107,'2018-04-10 10:41:12'),('8bixlm','Call Me by Your Name - What Would It Sound like Today?','Whether it\'s the tinny pop hits on a cheap radio in the background, or a classical piece accompanying a bicycle ride through town in the foreground, Call Me by Your Name\'s music plays a strong role in nurturing the atmospheric, encompassing nature of the film... but what would it sound like today?\r\n\r\nI stumbled across the following song during a late-night Spotify sesh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jda_k6r9R1A\r\n\r\nAfter a couple listens through, I started to hear this thing being played through one of those aforementioned tinny radios in the movie.

I was struck by how horrific Lady Deathstrike\'s fate in this film is. Firstly, she\'s a mindless slave to a man who wants to eradicate her species, so let\'s start there. Then she meets someone who is just like her, presumably for the first time. \r\n\r\nFrom the way Cyclops talks about this form of mind control later in the film, it\'s implied that she would maintain her consciousness in a Get Out kind of a way. From the way Wolverine talks about the curse of his immortality throughout the X-Men franchise, we can assume that she is equally as lonely. Finally, someone who understands this burden, someone who I won\'t outlive... but she has to fight him anyway.\r\n\r\nSo the fight goes on, and it ends with Wolverine pumping her full of cooling adamantium. Remember, Lady Deathstrike is immortal just like Logan. This won\'t kill her. As the metal cools and becomes solid, it becomes indestructible. It\'s all pumped straight into her abdomen, but she\'s filled with so much of the stuff that it comes out her fucking eyes somehow. She\'s completely filled with adamantium that must be molding around her insides perfectly as it solidifies.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have that awful moment just as the adamantium fills her where the mind control wears off. Earlier in the film, the mind control wore off briefly and needed to be topped up, so I assume this is just bad luck. If Logan had waited ten seconds longer, she would have come to her senses. As it is, she has just long enough to give Logan a look of acceptance, with no anger or blame, as if to say that she\'s OK with this. Then she fills to the brim with metal, undying, and solidifies into shape for all time.\r\n\r\nNothing will kill her, and nothing will destroy that metal. She will live for a thousand years as a statue from the inside out, condemned by the only person she could possibly have connected with on Earth. I would refer to her sentence as somewhat harsh, given that we never see her do anything wrong. The poor woman is mind controlled for almost the entirety of the film, with the exception of two brief moments of clarity. The only action we see her take of her own volition is the implicit forgiveness of Logan that she delivers with her silence directly before being frozen forever to silently meditate on that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this got me thinking if anything - *anything* - I\'ve ever seen on film is worse than that.

The past two decades have seen a huge upswing in the Superhero/Fantasy genre which has been great for a while but now is starting to feel.....well stale. I feel entitled even saying this but guess I\'m starting to feel over it. People are totally free to like whatever they like and I\'m happy that people enjoy these movies but is anyone else starting to wonder what all this costs us...culturally? Like, I know Hollywood has always been risk adverse but I feel like this decade is a new low. Almost every single big budget movie is either a loosely based comic adaption, a remake of some 80\'s or 90\'s movie to fuel nostalgia, or a Star Wars movie. It\'s very possible I\'m crazy but is anyone else just kind of tired of all this? Do our big budget films represent where America is at culturally at this time? Are we really this creatively stunted and okay with our generation\'s greatest writers and directors having to remake and re adapt movies made by the baby boomers? Could our Star Wars even be made now? I don\'t think it could. I don\'t think studio heads like Alan Ladd jr. are around today and I don\'t think any studio would be willing to give a young director that kind of cash for a passion project experiment. I guess the question I\'m asking r/movies is do you think I\'m being a snob and there\'s nothing wrong with the state of blockbuster film making or do you think Hollywood\'s risk aversion and piss poor leadership has gotten to the point where movies are being written by committee and end up lacking the nuance of even blockbuster films 20 to 30 years ago (compare Jurassic Park to Jurassic World).

You see it in the borderline anarchic depiction of Detroit, in the cynicism of the OCP characters, in the sadistic villains, and in the treatment of Robocop himself, who gets cut to pieces and then rebuilt only to be reprogrammed. I don\'t know if this was the writers/Orion Pictures/Irvin Kershner wanting to \'go bigger\' on the sardonic, cynical elements of the original, but the result makes for what I can best describe as \'unpleasant\' viewing at times. The cynical tone takes away the entertainment value somewhat, even though *Robocop 2* has what would be the best production values of the trilogy and good action scenes. Then again, Kershner was apparently brought in late in pre-production, so perhaps a lack of prep time for him could explain some issues that it had.\r\n\r\nDaniel O\'Herlihy\'s \'Old Man\', the CEO of OCP, has changed from being somewhat benign in the first movie to arguably worse than Ronny Cox\'s Dick Jones, turning into the cliched evil CEO who puts corporate interests above all else. Tom Noonan is weirdly compelling as Cain, a sadistic drug lord with a God complex, but isn\'t as memorable as Kurtwood Smith\'s Clarence Boddicker, possibly due to his limited screen time. Gabriel Damon\'s \'foul-mouthed child killer\', Hob, who constantly drops F-bombs and has no compunction about killing people, seems to have been placed there for shock value, and while his death is played as a low point, presumably for the audience to feel bad about him, the character never redeems himself or \'sees the light\' in order to warrant pity. \r\n\r\nThe issue of Murphy\'s humanity - or lack thereof - had potential, but it seems to have only been given lip service in the form of a couple of scenes - at least the issue of Murphy\'s family, in particular his wife, is addressed more fully, if only briefly. Apparently quite a few scenes were cut, which would have fleshed out the characters more. Some are available on YouTube, but others are still \'out there\' and are only available in the form of stills and brief descriptions. \r\n\r\nNow to *Robocop 3.* Apparently set for release in 1992, Orion Pictures\' bankruptcy delayed the release to 1993. *Robocop 3* was an attempt to broaden the audience appeal by lowering the rating, since the character had become popular with children - an animated series and a toy line were released in 1988, yet actual Robocop movies were hitherto off-limits to children. The movie is sometimes cited as an example of \'neutering\' a previously R-rated franchise, but I don\'t believe that more graphic violence and F-bombs would make the movie better. You *do* see bloody gunshot wounds, but they\'re not as graphic or sanguine as in the first two movies. Characters swear surprisingly frequently, but there are no F-bombs.\r\n\r\nThe movie is apparently set around Christmas, as evidenced by some of the sets having Christmas decorations, although Christmas has no obvious thematic significance to the movie - at least, none that I can glean from a rewatch. I wonder if this was due to Shane Black\'s influence, as he tends to set his movies around Christmas. Black doesn\'t have a writing credit on *Robocop 3,* but he has worked with writer-director Fred Dekker in the past, and he has a cameo as a police officer.\r\n\r\nRobert John Burke is, in my opinion, a worthy successor to Peter Weller. As for the other actors, some of the performances (notably Rip Torn as the new CEO of OCP, and a few of John Castle\'s scenes as mercenary leader Paul McDaggett) seem to be exaggerated, almost comically so, which somehow makes the movie seem \'cartoonish\' and adds to the sense of cheesiness.\r\n\r\n*Robocop 3* had a limited budget, and it shows - action set pieces are smaller in scale and less visually impressive than in the first two movies. One of the things Dekker had wanted to do was have Hong Kong-style martial arts acrobatics and action - something still unseen in an American movie at the time - with the ninja character Otomo, but didn\'t have the budget to pull it off. In a retrospective, he said that he would have liked to bring over a HK stunt team.\r\n\r\nI may be wrong, but this could be one of the last times stop-motion visual effects technology was used prominently in a major movie, with *Terminator 2* showing the potential of CGI two years prior and *Jurassic Park,* released earlier that year, showing that it was viable for producing photorealistic VFX. \r\n\r\nYes, *Robocop 3* is the weakest of the trilogy, but I think it still has some entertainment value as the light, fun, cheesy entry in the franchise. It flows better and isn\'t as mean-spirited as *Robocop 2,* Basil Poledouris returns as composer, and we finally get to see some new hardware for Robocop. I\'m reluctant to use the word \'campy\' because it implies a degree of self-awareness and exaggerated humour, and for its lighter tone, *Robocop 3* is largely straight-faced and too serious to qualify as campy in my opinion. Of course, others may disagree.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of *Robocop 2* and *Robocop 3?*\r\n\r\nSources: http://robocoparchive.com/misc/cut2.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://robocoparchive.com/archive/movie-robocop3-dekker.htm\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSTFdVnM-U0\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNAOpxm8CDE\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GaHOW9hkc\r\n\r\n\r\n','Last Christmas',23,33,'2018-06-04 06:46:25'),('8or39p','First Official Images From \'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\'','','How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World',1358,235,'2018-06-05 10:08:54'),('8otbiu','First Image from the Addams Family Animated Movie','','The Addams Family',46975,1986,'2018-06-05 14:38:45'),('8ouoqs','New image of the \'Light Fury\' from How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World','','How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World',5872,368,'2018-06-05 17:21:09'),('8ozhus','First Poster - \'London Fields\' | Amber Heard, Billy Bob Thornton, Jim Sturgess, Theo James, Johnny Depp, Cara Delevingne, Jaimie Alexander','','Good Boys',255,65,'2018-06-06 06:23:13'),('8p0em0','SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE - Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube','','Joker',47403,3764,'2018-06-06 09:00:31'),('8p2zvv','Which characters have the most egregious example of ignoring the truth about a killer/ghost/villain until it was too late?','I was watching the first Child\'s Play and it seems that from Andy, to the Mom, to the Cop, to the Partner, everyone just kept dismissing the warnings only to find out the hard way...

Don\'t let this turn you off to the film though, it is far and away the best anime movie I\'ve ever seen and a strong contender in the list of movies I would consider the greatest of all time. \r\n\r\n**NOTE: Kizumonogatari is actually a 3 part movie, but each part flows pretty much directly into the next so from here on outward I\'ll be referring to it as a single \'movie.\'**\r\nThe 3 parts are:\r\n\r\n**Kizumonogatari Part 1: Tekketsu**\r\nWound Story Part 1: Iron Blood\r\n\r\n**Kizumonogatari Part 2: Nekketsu**\r\nWound Story Part 2: Hot Blood\r\n\r\n**Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu**\r\nWound Story Part 3: Cold Blood \r\n\r\n**Presentation:** The main draw initially of Kizumonogatari is it\'s absolutely gorgeous animation coupled with the somewhat abstract and unique artistic sensibilities of series director Tatsuya Oishi from Studio Shaft. Though the general artistic style can be somewhat difficult to adapt to at first, I soon found myself accustomed to and enjoying the unique style along with the, I must reiterate, breath-taking animation. (Note: There a few parts in which CG is used in a somewhat jarring manner, though it doesn\'t take away from one\'s enjoyment and in a perverse way even kind of fits the rest of the movie.)\r\n\r\n**Plot:** The plot of Kizumonogatari is best described as a re-imagining of the typical vampire story; it has a way of twisting the common themes and subverting them in subtle (and not so subtle) ways while still remaining closer to the original essence of vampires than many other purported \'vampire\' movies. Beyond that Kizumonogatari explores some personal themes through the eyes of the protagonist as well as more general tropes, in some cases even subtly subverting again common story-telling tropes.\r\n\r\n**Writing:** Kizumonogatari is a novel adaption, and a damn good novel at that. The writing is strong in almost all regards, from engaging characters to interesting dialogue (that at times can be somewhat dense, much to the chagrin of the translators). Kizumonogatari possess a unique atmosphere that is translated exceptionally well to the silver screen.\r\n\r\n**OST:** Kizumonogatari\'s OST is varied but consistently high quality, with a few tracks in particular standing out and one of my favorite credit songs that I\'ve ever heard. \r\n\r\n**Cons:** As much as I love this movie, there are a couple of scenes that I find fall immensely flat and and are considerably jarring, one in particular seemed exceptionally out of place. What\'s even more unfortunate is that the scene(s) in question are of a considerably risque nature, adding to the jarring awkwardness of the whole experience. But overall I think the things that the movie(s) does well or incredibly far outnumber the unfortunately noticeable parts where it falls flat. You\'ll know the scene I\'m talking about in particular when you see it but please try to forgive it.\r\n\r\nConcluding Thoughts: This is my first time writing something like this so it\'s probably come out as a confusing mess, but I honestly cannot recommend the movie enough and hope that I can inspire as many people as possible to experience it.\r\n\r\n**Related Media:** Kizumonogatari is a prequel movie to the Monogatari anime series; as it is a prequel there are no relevant plot details hidden away in the rest of the series though, and Kizumonogatari is capable of standing on it\'s own. If you\'re inspired to look into the series I must warn that it was produced far in advance of Kizumonogatari and for TV, so while being a good looking show (that also embraces many of the more abstract or \'artsy\' stylistic features the movie has), it can\'t really hold a candle to Kizumonogatari and is slower paced in general. It\'s still really good and the characters are explored more in-depth throughout the course of the series, if you\'re interested just search for \'Monogatari Series Watch Order\' and you\'ll be good to go.        \r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Anime movie about a vampire and a boy trying to regain his humanity. Incredible Animation, Art Style and Writing. A couple of shitty scenes and a bit of questionable CG but overall really good. Go watch it.','Shaft',130,40,'2018-06-10 10:25:55'),('8q9r9d','Box Office Week: Ocean\'s 8 takes #1 with a very good $41.5M, a franchise best.

Now with this weekend over it seems like Incredibles II will be the big victor but Ocean\'s 8 still likely got some of that residual heat as the female lead sequel/reboot of the heist series has opened to a franchise high of $41.5M. Of course adjusting for inflation it\'s not so high, in fact it\'s the worst! Queue angry comments about title, etc. I\'ve never been a big fan of adjusting for inflation but here I can accept it as we are just 11 years out from the last film and the landscape is much similar than say comparing a film from 30 years ago. Still I think Ocean\'s 8 is in the right spot for an Ocean\'s film opening, a franchise that always opened low but had fabulous multipliers with the last two over 3x and the first an incredible 4.8x multiplier. Ocean\'s 8 could hold well in the coming weeks as the female audiences came out for the film with 69&#37; of the audience female and scoring great marks for women under the age of 18 who could have the social media power to keep the film running. Overall the film scored a B\\+ on Cinemascore, the same as 11 and 13 so expect it to hold pretty well barring a major drop\\-off in the wake of Incredibles II. Time will tell if this film has the staying power of the others but with a modest budget of $70M (what a world where that is considered restraint) it\'s aiming for a pretty good return and it is a good example of revitalizing a seemingly dormant franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Hereditary** \\- The Sundance critics favorite finally came out this weekend and made a major splash in many ways as it became the highest opening ever for A24 (hell the only time a film of theirs has opened in double digits) as the horror film opened at #4 with $13M. The debut feature film from writer/director Ari Aster received widespread critical acclaim and was hailed in the marketing as one of the scariest movies ever. It seems audiences however, or at least the ones polled by Cinemascore, disagreed as they gave it a terrible rating of D\\+. Having seen the film myself I can\'t say I\'m surprised, as half my audience were opening mocking and laughing the film by the end. It\'s a very very weird film and despite A24s recutting and ADR to give the film a little more coherence, its craziness seems to be turning off many. Oddly this isn\'t a total critic v audience affair as on r/movies and IMDB the film is quite acclaimed as well, so it\'s hard to know exactly WHO is turned off and how important their voice is. A24 reaaaaallly wants a big horror hit so let\'s look at their last two attempts: The VVitch (C\\- on Cinemascore) and It Comes at Night (D\\+ on Cinemascore). The VVitch was their first foray into wide release horror and had pretty straight forward marketing. The film opened alright to $8.8M but actually held better than expected with a 2.8x multiplier. It Comes at Night was a different matter. The film was promoted as a creature feature but was actually a depressing moody film about disease and death which really turned off audiences. The film opened to $5.9M and then dropped like a rock and had a 2.2x multiplier. It\'s likely Hereditary will fall somewhere in there but it\'s possible the strong word of mouth online could surprise the usual Cinemascore correlation. A24 is desperate to crack this horror market but they keep picking the wrong kind of films to do that. These bizarre auteur driven films are just not the crowd pleasers that still critically liked but more traditional studio horror films have become (ex. Get Out, It, A Quiet Place). I\'m glad they bring these films to the masses but if they really want to make their first $100M domestic grosser it\'s not going to be a movie where >!Toni Collette saws her own head off!<.\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Hotel Artemis** \\- Another week, another worst opening of all time as this time the powerhouse Global Road added a new notch to their failure belt with Hotel Artemis which had a horrible opening at #8 with $3.1M  The film had the 46th worst opening of all time, not the highest echelons of bad but still not great for GR\'s attempts to break into that sweet John Wick style market. Despite the film\'s stacked cast it doesn\'t carry a big budget, just $15M, which it will not come close to reaching but it might squeeze together in VOD and streaming sales. This whole film just feels like a direct to Netflix movie that for some reason was released wide and the public seemed to all collectively decide let\'s just wait for Netflix on this one.

I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into when I decided to watch this documentary tonight. \r\n\r\nTo preface everything, I have loved Jim Carrey since I was a kid. Every movie he was ever in, I had to have. The Mask, Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber. I watched one those movies from start to finish once a day for almost my entire childhood. When I got into my teen years, I started watching them, and when they were over I would watch all the special features. There was something so fascinating to me about watching him work his magic behind the scenes. This film was one giant special feature. \r\n\r\nHis films were a way for me to escape my problems as a child. Bullying, depression, anxiety. The struggles of not living up to expectations. Jim Carrey helped me through all that, and he inspired me to use humor and making people laugh as a way to escape everything when I couldn\'t sit down to watch him.I had always heard that Jim had created an indescribable performance as Andy, but I never watched Man On The Moon, but I never actually watched it. I\'ll be buying it tomorrow. Watching Jim transform into Andy was, by far, the most interesting thing I\'ve ever seen. \r\n\r\nWatching the lengths he went to in order to capture every mannerism, every tick, every behavioral mechanism of Andy\'s brain was awe-inspiring. He was the very essence of Andy Kaufman to the point where Andy\'s own sister believed that Jim was a vessel for Andy to communicate with the world again. Andy\'s daughter came onto set and spoke to Jim as Andy, and they had an hour long conversation while he was completely in character. This is a step above method acting, I honestly don\'t know what to call it. I was completely captivated the entire time.\r\n\r\nPlease, if you haven\'t seen this, do yourself a favor and watch it. This insight into how Jim portrayed Andy, and just how much it changed him is mind blowing.','The Tomorrow Man',3,11,'2018-06-13 03:23:01'),('8qqmsn','DUMBO - NEW TEASER TRAILER | Official Disney UK','','Dumbo',0,5,'2018-06-13 03:49:11'),('8qqnnx','Official Teaser Poster - Dumbo 2019','','Dumbo',946,65,'2018-06-13 03:54:40'),('8qvmyr','Cinerama Dome Given 1969 Facelift for Quentin Tarantino\'s ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD','','Once Upon a Time in Hollywood',154,21,'2018-06-13 16:13:44'),('8qxx14','First Image From Mystery \'Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase\' - Starring Sophia Lilis, Laura Wiggins, and Andrea Anders','','Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase',304,27,'2018-06-13 21:32:09'),('8r0all','Saw Incredibles 2 yesterday (Spoiler Free)','I’ve been playing it back in my head since walking out.

For the first half hour, it was one of the worst films I’d ever seen. By the midway point, I could see some merit, but it was such a ridiculous mess, I wasn’t sure if I could get to the end. By the end, I felt torn. Seeing the film as a whole, I suddenly couldn’t decide if I hated it or not. There was something to it that I couldn’t place my finger on. \r\n\r\nThe next day, it was all I could think about. Certain scenes played over in my head. So I decided to rewatch it. I have to say, I’ve completely flipped. I LOVE this movie. Once my mind accepted what it was and what it was trying to do, I was finally able to appreciate it. \r\n\r\nIt’s such a sincere love letter to this cartoon world. The races are genuinely thrilling and beautiful. The pacing is breakneck and like no other film I’ve ever seen. In fact, its best not to view this as a film but as an experience. The characters are so over the top, but never in a mocking way. They’re all playing straight, yet, they know what kind of movie they’re in. \r\n\r\nThere are some major hurdles to get over in order to enjoy it though. The world is so over saturated, it looks like the set of Lazytown. This is intentional of course, but it kind of looks ridiculous at times, especially in the flashbacks to Speed’s childhood. Which brings us to the second thing: Yes, his real name is Speed Racer. His dad’s name is Pops. That’s just what this world is. Next, the cgi at times is distractingly bad, most notably in the factory scenes. It looks great in the races, but everything in the factory looks like Spy Kids. And lastly, Spritle and the Chimp. Speed’s little brother and their pet chimp fit in the world fine and work with the film, but there are a few moments were their presence is pretty insufferable, most notably in the aforementioned factory. Best to just ignore that scene and just pay attention to Speed’s part in it. \r\n\r\nIf you can get past that, or if those things don’t bother you at all, then you are in for a treat. I personally will be buying this film in the highest quality I can find. It’s so fun and mind bending and just genuinely great.  Some of you will hate this film with a fiery passion, and I can understand why, but some of you will hopefully see it as I do, and you’ll be so happy you did.

One of the main criticism of the Lord of the Rings the Return of the King was how this battle was ended. May critics were praising it for one of the best cinematic actions of all time, while many states it was the worst, mainly for how it ended with the use of the Army of the Dead. In the book, the army of the dead has much less of a role. Mainly, Aragorn uses them to take over the ships and then gathers a massive army of men to take the battle strategically from both sides. While many argue that seeing this play out would have been much more tactical and cinematically compared to the anti-climax of the army of the dead, I don\'t think they could have possibly done this. Assuming that nothing else changed about the movie, Saurons army was only too large for any reasonable force to eliminate. And watching a human army take it out might have been too exhausting for the watchers, especially since another battle would be taking place about 20 minutes after the end of this one. Perhaps Jackson made the enemy army too large. Tolkien states the military was around 150,000 orcs and Men. While they don\'t indicate the size in Jackson\'s adaptation, it does seem more significant (I seem to remember somewhere in the commentary that it was around 600,000 but I can\'t find any sources to confirm that). But the army doesn\'t seem to decrease as the battle goes on. Perhaps if they showed the numbers of the enemy decreasing  Tolkien\'s ending would have been possible to film?

I removed a lot, and tried to make it more clear. I\'m trying to pick apart ideas that scenes are having on a meta level. With how much this movie shows televisions and talks about watching media I want to analyze it on this level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncredibles 2 opens with this romantic idea of a villain fight. Everyone is doing the masculine action of fighting the villain. The family is in chaos, and the villain gets away. After this fight, the movie slaps you in the face. They can’t go back to their house. The organization that helps them is shut down.\r\n\r\nThey have a family fight over dinner. The dad represents romantic ideals of being yourself, while the mom is set on them just surviving. While they are talking about superpowers, they are also arguing the different ideologies of today, and of that time in the sixties. \r\n\r\n    Then a romantic comes to the rescue. He knows the theme songs. He idolizes supers. He wants to make a political change. He gives them the power to do this. He chooses the Mother to make this change. The Mom is reinvigorated with life and thrives, her cynical acceptance of their situation drops. His sister(the villain) is a cynic. She sees the world(and us) as sheep staring at screens, consuming products.\r\n\r\n    Jack jack is watching tv one night and sees a cop fighting a crook. He then spots a raccoon, and fights with it. This movie is arguing that the things we watch do have an impact on us. The majority of the film is showing empowered women, and the dad struggling in his mother role. This movie is trying to do for the world as what tv did for jack jack. Void is this inspired girl the movie wants to impress.  \r\n\r\n    Elastigirl and the villain have a conversation early in the movie about the nature of their campaign. The cynic in her says that their political campaign is just what its sold as, not what it is. This applies to the movie itself. That would make this just another superhero film. Are we sheep for liking this? Its structured the same as the first one, with many of the same scenes. The memory wipe scene. The dinner scene. Elastigirl struggles to fly a jet. One of the parents go off to do superheroing. They even argue over pushing a button at one point. Etc. \r\n\r\nWell this is where romanticism wins. It works so well on its surface level. The cinematography and animation quality set a new standard. The soundtrack and visuals blare its noir setting. It even uses experimental abrasive visuals in the epilepsy room fight. It has so many creative ideas. The ship, the bike, jack jack’s powers, the house, the new supers, and screenslayers abilities. \r\n\r\nSo no, this movie isn’t just marketing, or spewing of politics. It wins its battle against this cynical villain. It has nuance. Elastigirl says before shooting Screenslayer, ”At least I have values”. Mr.Incredible uses his masculinity and determination to succeed in caring for the kids. We need to progress our societal ideas, without throwing the super-baby out with the bathwater. We need to help each other, as the know-it-all Edna helps Mr.Incredible. Romanticism will win in the end, with supers legalized. Just as it\'s not rejecting all american values, its not denying the superhero movie values of having a happy ending. \r\n\r\n','Isn\'t It Romantic',0,11,'2018-07-02 12:14:31'),('8vkp0h','High Crimes is basically the same movie as Primal Fear','I didn\'t tag this with spoilers, because the movies are so old, but if you haven\'t seen these movies, you might want to turn back and watch them before reading this thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently re-watched High Crimes (2002) a couple weeks ago, and then last night, popped in Primal Fear (1996).  After watching them again, I found it funny that I decided to watch those two movies in particular so close to each other, because they basically seem like the same movie to me now.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth are court room dramas, focusing on a seemingly sweet, innocent man.  Both have the accused being defended by a lawyer who is pretty convinced they are innocent of the crime they are being accused of.

I remember back when its trailers released that nobody was really looking forward to the film and many people thought it would be a disaster. How can a movie based on a Disneyland ride be any good after all? Plus pirate movies were long out of fashion and Johnny Depp was considered box office poison.\r\n\r\nBut after it came out it surprised so many people. The movie soley cruised on word of mouth as it legged all the way to 305 million from a 46 million opening weekend. I remember how Jack Sparrow became the most popular costume that Halloween and how much the film dominated pop culture talk that summer.\r\n\r\nIts no wonder why because the movie is simply perfect as a summer blockbuster. Not a thing in a movie needs to change and each and every aspect works perfectly. It was a lightning in a bottle situation which sadly no sequel was able to equal. Its goodwill is reflected by how Dead Mans Chest did at the box office. Pirates 2 opened with the best ever opening weekend 2006 at the time and was only the 3rd movie to break a billion after Titanic and LOTR: Return of the King.\r\n\r\nI would recommend a rewatch/watch of Curse to fellow redditors as this is the season to enjoy it.

I liked the world-building, with the idea of ancient MUTOS and an organisation (Monarch) dedicated to their study, but I felt that the movie didn\'t \'flow\' very well; I\'m trying to figure out how to word it, but the movie as a whole seems like a collection of scenes that somehow don\'t work well as a cohesive plot.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been exposed to no end of spoilers, and now I can appreciate why people felt that Bryan Cranston was \'wasted\', dying at the end of the first act. We\'re led to believe that his character would be of significance throughout the movie, but realistically, the way the story is written, he wouldn\'t have anything meaningful to contribute after the male MUTO escapes anyway, so he would just fade into the background. This is something of an issue, because Cranston\'s character was the most interesting in the movie; all the others weren\'t interesting, but at least they weren\'t unlikeable. There was nothing wrong with Aaron Taylor-Johnson\'s performance, but he seemed kind of... flat somehow; while his motivations were understandable, he just didn\'t seem interesting as a lead, and as a result I just didn\'t feel \'connected\' or \'engaged\' enough to want to follow him.\r\n\r\nAlso, I can understand - and agree with - the criticism that Godzilla himself didn\'t get much screen time. Godzilla looks awesome - when you see him. While I can appreciate that the writers/producers/Gareth Edwards wanted to save the big kaiju fight for the end, it was frustrating to have the movie cut away from fights or even clear shots of the creatures, first at the Janjira site when the male MUTO escapes, then the battle in Honolulu, and then in San Francisco when Elizabeth Olsen\'s character evacuates to a BART subway. In the creatures\' absence, the movie drags somewhat, particularly in the second act.\r\n\r\nEven though this version may have a \'better\' Godzilla creature, had good world-building, and is setting up a cinematic \'monsterverse\', I feel that of the two American Godzilla movies, *Godzilla \'98* is still the better movie. It showed a lot of its Godzilla (Roland Emmerich was done hiding Godzilla by the end of the first act), its human characters were more interesting if not likeable, it flowed better, and you actually *felt* for Godzilla by the end. Besides a sense of awe at the sheer size of Godzilla, there\'s no emotional connection to Godzilla in the 2014 movie - that may seem unusual to say about a giant monster, but the 1998 movie showed it could be done.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I\'m still curious about *Godzilla: King of the Monsters.*','Godzilla: King of the Monsters',4,22,'2018-07-11 10:33:25'),('8y0l59','First Image of Jack Dylan Grazer & Zachary Levi as Freddy Freeman & Shazam in \'Shazam!\'','','Shazam!',36991,2626,'2018-07-11 11:33:36'),('8y14h8','8 big movie are all opening in the same 7/8 seven day period from Dec. 14 -21.

So you have the party portion that preceded the killings as one scenario.

Each one of them was handpicked as the best of the best, elevated to a point of being an in-universe demigod of war.  \r\n\r\nAlex shows what the gunstars are capable of, in his first pass in the big battle he kills probably a hundred enemy pilots then dog fights the rest of them.

And in the ideal situation, there are six more gunstars also reaping a bloody swathe.  \r\n\r\nIf they are actually making a new Starfighter movie, show me what the Starfighters are capable at full strength.

You’re perfectly open to disagree with me. Also, **SPOILERS FOR SICARIO AND SICARIO: DAY OF THE SOLDADO**, obviously.\r\n\r\n**Alejandro should not have survived.** This is rough, I know, but the scene where he wakes up in the sand reeks of cliche, and if anything is the antithesis of cliche, it’s *Sicario* with its cynical take on the conflicts between the US/Mexico border. The first movie was a no happy ending, no bullshit ordeal. The second movie should follow suit.\r\n\r\nWhy would his death make more sense? In the first *Sicario*. Alejandro tells Kate Macer **“You will not survive here. You are not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves”.** Alejandro essentially tells Kate that she cannot fight the border and all that it holds because she has morals and soft feelings. Alejandro also begins to display softness towards the end of *Sicario: Day of the Soldado*. When Matt Graver receives orders to kill Isabela Reyes. Alejandro defies him, instead choosing to escort Isabela back into the US for her own safety. This is obviously a display of affection for Isabela, seeing as how Alejandro has had no issues killing the children of jefes who have wronged him in the past. He even threatened to kill Kate in the first movie despite likening her to his own daughter.\r\n\r\nIsabela, for whatever reason, turns Alejandro into a soft and caring person, which leaves him vulnerable to cold, harsh reality. Because of this, he is ironically shot by a random teen aspiring to be a “wolf”. Alejandro, on the other hand, is no longer a wolf, and as such, should not be able to survive in that world. By letting Alejandro die, *Sicario 2* would have not only respected its predecessor and the ideas that were conveyed, but driven the nail home with a morbid sense of finality that could rival or even outshine the “time to meet god” scene of the first movie. The only harm this could do is hamper the third movie, for obvious reasons, but I think controlling the script of one movie to simply set up the next is absolutely fucking stupid. *Movies should inspire sequels, not the other way around!* I don’t even know what *Sicario 3* could possibly be about without turning into a tired cliche fest lacking originality.\r\n\r\nSome other smaller comments that I have:\r\n\r\n* **Isabela can still be spared by Matt** and I feel it wouldn’t mess with the tone of the movie too much. I can totally buy that Matt develops a bond with Alejandro in their shared homicidal escapades, and that sparing Isabela is his way of honoring his fallen “brother”. This could also provide Isabela as a character to somewhat fill in the void that Alejandro would leave in *Sicario 3*.\r\n* The god awful **“So you want to be a sicario? Let’s talk about your future.”** line could actually kind of work if it was Matt talking to the teen since it sounds like some casual sarcastic bullshit he would say. Best case scenario, in my opinion? Cut that line out. Completely. Ugh. I’m just saying Josh Brolin’s character *MIGHT* be able to deliver it without seemingly totally cheesed.\r\n* **Condense the sequence between meeting Angel and Alejandro’s execution**. The first half felt like “movie 1” and then an abrupt cut to “movie 2” in the second half. Totally different pace and tone. I’m sure there are a lot of small throwaway lines and filler shots that can be removed to help speed things up a little bit. I shouldn’t be checking my watch during the climax of the movie.\r\n* **“The terrorists were from New Jersey”** remove that line entirely. Why does the opening scene exist if the movie is going to contradict it later on? It is clearly established that terrorists are being trafficked across the US/Mexico border, so don’t double back on it, that was just messy story telling. If they needed an excuse for the President to cut off Matt’s operation, the shootout with the Mexican federal police should be more than enough justification.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** Alejandro should have died because it is more appropriate for the ideas established in the world of *Sicario*, and various small gripes that I won’t bother condensing (sorry).\r\n\r\nNever the less, I really liked both *Sicario* and *Sicario: Day of the Soldado*. The second one is just much less polished, likely due to studio/director/producer interference with the script to help setup for *Sicario 3*.','Angel Has Fallen',4,10,'2018-07-23 11:05:48'),('9185lp','Alita: Battle Angel - Official Trailer','','Alita: Battle Angel',22770,3574,'2018-07-23 11:45:40'),('9194np','Cat People (1942) - The Beginning of Jump Scares in Horror Movies','','Cats',137,20,'2018-07-23 13:36:06'),('91achy','10 of the biggest Comic-Con reveals - Godzilla, Shazam, Fantastic Beasts and other big reveals','','Shazam!',12,3,'2018-07-23 15:53:12'),('91anzh','Richard Linklater\'s \'Boyhood\' was titled \'12 Years\' until he discovered 12 Years a Slave was soon to be released.','','Good Boys',3726,323,'2018-07-23 16:28:34'),('91bne1','Caleb Landry Jones Joins Jim Jarmusch’s Zombie Movie ‘The Dead Don’t Die’','','The Dead Don\'t Die',184,43,'2018-07-23 18:25:13'),('91e746','Tarantino converted Hollywood blvd into 1969 for his Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\"\" movie.\"\"','','Once Upon a Time in Hollywood',732,170,'2018-07-24 00:17:46'),('91emci','SDCC wrap up','Hey everyone now that Comic Con has wrapped up & (hopefully) everyone has seen all the content that’s come out of the show, what is everyone’s favourite trailer that debuted over the weekend? \r\n\r\nAlso what is the general vibe around the movies that we got content for?

Paul Thomas Anderson. I was a bit skeptical going into this movie. I had only watched 3 PTA’s work before this, *Hard Eight*, *Boogie Nights*, and *Punch-Drunk Love*. Despite the raving praise from most critics and fans, it seems to have a big share of its dislikes/haters. “Pretentious”, “it never quite gets to the point”, “it’s too far up it own ass/indulgent/too long” and “it doesn’t deliver on what it teases/promises” are things that I’ve often heard about it, not to mention PTA himself saying that he would cut 20 minutes from it. Having seen it now, I can’t help but disagree with this notion, well perhaps disagree is the wrong word, I can see and understand those points of views, I just didn’t feel the same way. Even though I watched it when I was very tired, any other regular movie might have just put me to sleep, let alone a 3 hour one, but this one kept me engaged all the way through, right from the start, it grips you, from the narration to the title cards with the songs and introduces characters where it demands you to be focused from 10 seconds in. Full with an ensemble cast whose story are told all at the same time, it’s a modern melodrama done right, and now that I’ve thought about it, it weirdly reminds me of Douglas Sirk’s *Imitation of Life*, although they do not have much in common in terms of characters or themes. It wasn’t until roughly when there was 40 minutes left in the movie where it finally hit me, where I felt like I understood what the director and the movie was trying to portray and say. It took me way too long(to be fair I was quite tired) but it’s obvious, just like most of PTA’s other work, it’s a movie about family, mainly the relationship dynamics between parents and children, and how these dynamics can come to form us, for better or worse. It’s about the lies we tell, it’s about how we act, about being nicer human beings, forgiveness, regret and doing the right thing. Then the frogs came down, I was confused, still am. The first thing that comes to my head(like I imagine most people) is the story of Moses and how god sent down frogs in the form of rain to punish the Egyptians, but I do not see how this biblical story plays into the story of this movie at all, but just like the characters, I just accept it after a while, and move on with the movie. (after doing some further research it seems that PTA didn’t even intend this to reference to the exodus story, but added references to it later on after some people asked him if that was what he was referring to) It\'s full of stories loosely intertwined leading you to think(mainly through the narrator) that these things will come together and we’ll have some kind of payoff, crazy coincidences like the ones that he tells in the beginning. It never pays off of course, but it also feels incredibly unimportant and irrelevant, because it is, ultimately a misdirection, or so I think. It always feels bad to try to reduce a film to a certain theme, to simplify it, but in the end, *Magnolia* is about family, parent and children relationships in particular and how that forms us into what we are, and how that past is never done with us, even if we are with it. At its core is Stanley who is going through the same things that most of this movie’s characters have gone through, and maybe it’s only me, but perhaps there is hope for change, even if his father seemed to shut it down quickly. Despite its ambitions, and certainly the ambitions of the director who said: “I really feel that, *Magnolia* is, for better or worse the best movie I’ll ever make”, it ultimately feels more intimate and personal than it does ambitious or epic, which is fine with me, despite it’s clumsiness sometimes. 9/10. Like many people, I know about the infamous quote of PTA expressing his opinion of David Finchers *Fight Club*, where I learned that PTA’s dad died from cancer, something that I can’t help but connect to this movie, in which 2 different dads are both dying of Cancer. You can tell that it is a very personal story to him, and I can’t help but wonder about his relationship with his father, if it’s anything like what we saw in the movie. For some reason throughout the movie I just assumed that Steve Carell was the narrator, was confused when I turned up to be wrong lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/90z0mm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2u77f0/)\r\n\r\n* [**Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom** (Pier Paolo Pasolini) - Indigestible. There’s a type of film where the allegory is so incredibly obvious, that it’s meant to stand out and overpower the surface story. *The Seventh Seal* is a notable example of this. It’s true here in this film, but both the story and its noted allegory takes a back-seat to the still-disturbing shock elements that this film is most infamous for. Again, this is an obvious allegory for fascism and the abuse of power, and the repeated depraved sexual and violent acts that go on and on throughout the film, almost comes off as too simplified and trite. But then again, you look around at some of the developments going on in our world today, and apparently this message is unendingly relevant, and makes one wonder if it does indeed need to be told in such a basic and clear manner. The plot—what little trace of it—revolves around four men in a position of power who kidnap a group of young men and women and inflict increasingly sordid and violent acts of debauchery, torture, and humiliation to them. Overall, the directing is exceedingly well-done even though it’s such unrelentingly disturbing material. It’s well shot, lit, and staged, and the violent and sexual acts come off as very realistic, which could not have been easy to shoot or act through. The world building is exceptional as well. It takes place in a single palace, but it practically becomes its own character, with its own unique aesthetic, especially as we’re repeatedly returned to familiar rooms and places, whose often clean and elegant appearance creates such a stark contrast to the terrible sexual and violent acts that take place within them. In this, you could perhaps see a larger trace of a theme that links the environment with the human body, and the focus on anal penetration and feces. The movie *The Cook, the Thief, his Wife, and her Lover* had one of the best integrations of this type of symbolic link between an inter-connected set design and the human body, with the multi-linked kitchen that mimicked the stages of the human digestion system, each with its own separate functions. Undoubtedly, that movie was probably influenced by this movie. In art, the expulsion of urine or feces, can often be symbolic of getting rid of negativity; of the dark and unwanted portions of your life. It doesn’t look like that was really apparent in this film though, as the main intent was to hammer in the shock value, and keep its allegory front and center at all times. It also didn’t seem like this film was possibly implicating and linking us--the viewer--in voyeuristically indulging in this film’s numerous horrors of depravity, similar to what the four libertines do. I’d think for most people, the accumulated effect of all of this, actually creates further separation and distance from what we’re watching and the characters that do enjoy these horrible acts. This movie has definite historic value, and its message, unfortunately, seems to be timeless in its application. I’m not so sure, if I’d recommend this as something essential that you need to see though, since few people are going to get any enjoyment while watching it. This is a distorted reflection on one extreme end of the human condition, but it is a reflection on us nonetheless. Its message is so blaringly obvious, yet so consistently repeated and endemic throughout human history, that perhaps the only way to get us to truly examine this about us, is to bluntly and forcibly drag us through the grime and muck of it all, as this film attempted to do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/90z0mm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2uv6b2/)\r\n\r\nFor further expansion of the rules, [please read this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ygm2i/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dugffbn/).\r\n\r\nHave fun and play nice!','Little Women',110,232,'2018-07-29 12:00:29'),('9354fx','X-Men: Dark Phoenix and New Mutants Both Confirmed for 2019 by IMAX','','Dark Phoenix',1573,392,'2018-07-30 11:40:25'),('9388us','Let’s talk about Spring Breakers...','Yeah I know, but please just bare with me...\r\n\r\nI initially thought this movie was just pure shock value, a good way to grab audiences attention by having teen stars acting against type and a silly performance by James Franco at that.\r\n\r\nI just watched it on Netflix recently and I definitely I appreciated it a bit more on a 2nd viewing.

I can\'t think of any other movie that takes such an acclaimed, game-changer of a film, rides incredible hype for a follow up, and then systematically shits all over everything it did so well in the first movie. \r\n\r\nThe original movie is a smart tale of the dangers of taming the unknown in light of an unprecedented scientific breakthrough. The characters have their own clear and understandable motivations which are both the source of the drama and the reason for their survival. None of this can be said for TLW. It\'s a movie built on the premise that everyone is a fucking moron and people are evil for evil\'s sake. Let\'s just list out a few of the idiotic things that the plot relies on:\r\n\r\n* I don\'t see any reason why I would need to confess there\'s an island full of dinosaurs after so many people were eaten alive at the other place I had. I want them to roam without human intervention. Wait, what are satellites and boats?\r\n* Hey, let\'s build a park in San Diego because that is somehow more secure than an isolated island. What could go wrong?\r\n* I think it\'s a good idea to go ~alone~ to an island full of free-roaming dinosaurs where people famously were eaten alive as soon as they became free-roaming. (I know it\'s not the exact same island but still)\r\n* By the way, a teenage girl came too. How? I don\'t know, we won\'t address it.\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s just how the conflict begins. The film continues by having completely pointless or unlikable characters. Peter Stormare has no purpose in the film except to take 10 minutes to die. There\'s some hippie dino-nerd who literally walks into a T-Rex\'s mouth when a snake crawls on him. And to top it all off, you have a Green Peace terrorist who has no problem killing people if they captured dinosaurs by setting them free in their camps. Then the dude brings a **T-REX PUP BACK TO HIS OWN BASE CAMP** because it has a hurt leg? Guess how that ends. The rest of the deaths in this film stem directly from his actions in one night. And how is he rewarded for this? **HE SURVIVES AND SAVES THE DAY**. \r\n\r\nI don\'t even want to talk about a girl killing a velociraptor with gymnastics.\r\n\r\nThere is zero justification for any action that occurs in this movie which became an unfortunate trend in the following films.

Only slightly bummed hearing Christopher Nolan mention in an interview that he would\'ve like to see what wrinkles Kubrick would have ironed out if he hadnt passed away in the final stages. He said he hadnt even finished editing the soundtrack yet. I dunno, it seemed really complete to me, although maybe I did notice a little weirdness here or there, that you dont see in previous Kubrick films.\r\n\r\nThat said I did notice a kind of goofyness at times, and in some ways it did feel like a filmmaker who was indeed older, and not as in vogue stylistically at the time, but its hard to judge what 1999 was like anyhow. But Kubrick always has a weirdness and comical element anyway, thinking about Nicolas in the Shining.\r\n\r\nOverall I really got the feeling that the movie was dealing with human society, behavior, especially in context of relationships between men and women. That may sound obvious, and I think the film goes down maybe a few different avenues of subject. Or maybe just explores the same concepts under in different ways.\r\n\r\n\\---The Masks really connected to me, with the Fakeness everyone seems to be portraying toward each other. These people in relationships.......How rarely they show there true selves to each other. How much of the world around us, our cities and towns, are full of people wearing masks, never showing themselves to each other.\r\n\r\n\\---The Party or Ritual, The first part the ceremony\r\n\r\n.I really wish i hadnt seen so much about his movie before watching it. Seeing this for the first time and not expecting it must have been really impactful.\r\n\r\nI thought it was really creepy at first but then the chanting music started to sound beautiful and it hit me. I think this is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in cinema.\r\n\r\nI think its in a way...a love letter, but a metaphor for ourselves, our society, how we behave. I say love letter, because I think Kubrick is trying to show humanity here, as it truly is.....sort of fucked up to be honest.....although not all that bad right, its just sex and its all seemingly consensual. But the ritual aspect to it, and the grey sense of morality is what seems strange but what i think its just a very honest appraisal of modern human society.\r\n\r\nAll of Us wearing these masks, and the crazy rituals we all have around sex, the dances we do.\r\n\r\nI say love letter, not in a way I think Kubrick is celebrating it. But in a compassionate non judgemental way he is just presenting it, as it is. Which in the context of the centuries of denial and shame, presenting it as it is, is like a love letter.\r\n\r\nI think there is definitely the opportunity to sort of laugh at the sillyness of it all. After a while , As he walks around the party and seeing all the sex.....you realize ok...so they are all just having sex, why the big ritual, not so scary .  But thats as far as Kubrick goes, sort of shows the absurdity briefly.\r\n\r\nHe Doesnt then offer some eutopic alternative path we should be taking. He see societies as they are, and humans as they are. And just presents it. Honest reflections. The beauty comes from the honesty, and the truth in really seeing ourselves.\r\n\r\nBeing Awake.\r\n\r\n\\-\r\n\r\nOn the ending. The scene with him Sydney at the pool table. Amazing performances here by both actors. And i think its definitely an initiation scene. Basically he is secretly asking Tom, are you willing to cover up this murder and keep our secret, and deep down i think Tom knows what going on toward the end and is compliant. Tom shows a gitty intrigue ....to pull of secretly getting into that party, your see a really thrill seeking part of him. And he comes off as so unassuming  in the beginning of the movie, such a nice guy. But im thinking, this guys a Dr with a successful practice in NYC, where is his competitive dominant side. I think he shows his darker nature the night of the party, and with his silent intrigue with Pollacks character.\r\n\r\nstill trying to tie that over arching metaphor to Cruises characters, and what it means for him to then be initiated. He was playing the game before, Was awaken to the game, and now is i assume continue playing it knowing that he is playing it. \r\n\r\nTraditionally you would think someone is awaken to a secret of life, and then makes changes toward something more authentic. But it seems like these people are awaken to life, and now continue with the game with the knowledge of it.','Little Women',14,21,'2018-08-03 23:35:03'),('94nd7f','Pets getting separated from their owners, can we make a complete list of this plot trope and try to rank them?','I\'ll list off what I can think of.\r\n\r\nHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)\r\n\r\nHomeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco (1996)\r\n\r\nThe Incredible Journey (1963)\r\n\r\nBolt (2008)\r\n\r\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)\r\n\r\n101 Dalmatians (1996)\r\n\r\n102 Dalmatians (2000)\r\n\r\nBabe: Pig in the City (1998)    \r\n\\^does this count?\r\n\r\nSecret Life of Pets (2016)\r\n\r\nPaulie (1998)\r\n\r\nBeverly Hills Chihuahua (2008)\r\n\r\nLady and the Tramp (1955)','The Secret Life of Pets 2',2,10,'2018-08-04 19:18:09'),('94o82k','When are we going to have a legit A-list Asian-American leading man/woman?','I recall Lucy Liu was kinda big in the early 2000\'s after a few years on Ally McBeal.

He covered 1,994 miles, averaged 63.2 MPH, refueled nine times, and was stymied by a flat tire','I put this piece on Reddit last year, but I had to bring it back to celebrate the 20th anniversary of *Halloween H20: Twenty Years later.* This cross country trip is a thing of beauty and I feel the world needs to know more about it. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that can stop an unstoppable force is a red traffic light. For over 40 years Michael Myers and his driving skills have been scrutinized and mocked. How did a “shape” who lived in a mental institution learn how to operate a vehicle? Michael’s driving in the first film has never bothered me because the driving was erratic and primal. The driving that bothers me is in *Halloween H20: 20 Year Later* because he made a 1,994 mile trip successfully with zero citations or tickets. In the film Michael drives from Langdon, Illinois to Hillcrest Academy in Northern California in a daring feat that raises a lot of questions.\r\n\r\n1. Does he wear the mask when driving or siphoning gas?\r\n2. Did he listen to the radio?\r\n3. How does he deal with merging onto highways? Is he cool about it?\r\n4. Does he dislike people who drive slow in the fast lane?\r\n5. Does he not know how to fix a flat fire?\r\n\r\nI remember loving the film as an impressionable 15-year old punk. The movie had thrills, Dawsons Creek-esque dialogue and Jamie Lee Curtis going on the offensive. However, I’ve never liked that a mysterious shape could drive cross-country. Michael Myers works best as a mysterious murderer who doesn’t have parent issues and could care less about following traffic rules. He had to navigate a lot of terrain on his journey which means he had to follow the rules and not murder people who cut him off.  The trip took him an estimated 45.5 hours (thank you for the time change assist Reddit). Here is the timeline (with some guesswork and actual times from the movie):\r\n\r\n**October 29 – 5:30PM** – Leaves Langdon in a stolen 1971 Buick Skylark.  A  handy grandfather clock states that it is 5:30PM.\r\n\r\n**October 31 – 9:00AM** – Michael steals a 1956 International Harvester Travelall  at a rest stop off Highway 139 in Northern California.\r\n\r\n**October 31 – 10:00AM**– Arrives in the fictional town and cruises around a bit before he settles on main street at 11:00AM\r\n\r\n**October 31 – 1:00PM** – Follows Laurie from the downtown area and finds out where the school is.\r\n\r\n**Total time:** 45.5 hours\r\n\r\nBreakdown of hours\r\n\r\n32 (driving Highway/Susanville) + 6.5 (refueling) + 2 (waiting on main street) + 2.5 (waiting at rest stop) + 1 (eating? He eats rats in Resurrection…dude needs snacks) + 1.5 (nap?) = 45.5\r\n\r\nMichael left Langdon on October 29th at 5:30PM in a 1971 Buick Skylark and drove all the way to California. He was forced to stop close to his destination when an unfortunate flat tire forced him to stop at a rest stop along Highway 139. During the trip he had to make at least nine pit stops to refuel because the 71 Skylark only averaged 15 miles per gallon and the 15.2 gallon gas tank only got him a maximum of 228 miles. I think it might be easier for him to refuel at night but according to the math he had to make five daytime gas stops. That had to get kinda complicated because he had no money, doesn’t talk and didn’t steal any steal cars. \r\n\r\nTo make it in 29 hours like the Google map states he would have to drive 68 MPH. I don’t buy it so I slowed him down to 63.2 MPH. 63.2 X 32 hours on the road = 2.022.4. He covered 1,994 miles on the various highways and 28.4 on Highway 139 and various other roads after he found the school.\r\n\r\nSince Langdon and Hillcrest are fictional, I found cities that are relatively close to the locations. Langdon was in Livingston County, Illinois so I found a town that had a similar population. Then, I looked along Highway 139 in Northern California and picked Susanville due to its proximity to the highway and Yosemite State Park (because there is a convenient school trip there). The locations aren’t exact but I was working with fictional towns so I to make an educated guess.\r\n\r\nAfter coming up with the distance and car information I started thinking about Myers using his blinker while making turns or switching lanes. There is nothing less frightening than thinking about him casually flipping on the blinker to make a left turn. After looking at the directions Michael had to use his blinker AT LEAST 17 times (per google maps) if he always stayed in the slow lane. If you add the nine pit stops to exit the highway and his cruising around the small town that is somewhere around 40. Thus, Michael Myers the unstoppable killing force had to use his blinker 57 times. Immortal demons with pitch black eyes should never be bothered with speed limits, rear view mirrors and potential zipper merges.\r\n\r\nThere you have it!

We watched an old Godzilla film, that I remember, but then the next film came on and I have no idea what it was. All I can remember is this one scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s important to me because this scene stopped me sleeping for 3 nights in a row and gave me nightmares for weeks after.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically 2 people enter a room in a big, expensive but old and neglected house. I think these 2 with a bunch of other people are trying to escape the house. In this room is a statue of the grim reaper with a scythe. While they are cautiously exploring the room, the statue comes to life and as they try to escape, the woman of the 2 gets stabbed in the arm by the scythe, but I believe they get away. That\'s it. That scene crippled weeks of sleep and stays with me to this day. But I have no idea what the film is. I\'d love to go back and watch it to see what it\'s like from an older perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also vaguely remember a scene in this film where a man is on his own and comes across this very attractive lady who says she knows a way out and to follow her. He follows, but ends up getting caught in a huge web and she transforms into a weird spider lady maybe, shoots her jaw at his face and instantly sucks his body dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is all I can remember.

Chu’s film certainly delivers on the lavish trappings of the former interpretation, but if the latter is meant to be the mood of the film, it falls a little short. I wanted things to be a little crazier, I guess, wild high-society intrigue staged with the satisfying bite of mean, wicked satire.\r\n\r\n[Danny Yu - Time Out\r\n](https://www.timeout.com/us/film/crazy-rich-asians)\r\n> It’s a reinvented romantic comedy, sassy and fun, that doesn’t necessarily rely on obvious tropes and is worth the wait.\r\n\r\n[Leah Greenblatt - Entertainment Weekly\r\n](https://ew.com/movies/2018/08/08/crazy-rich-asians-review/)\r\n> the storyline is strictly something old and borrowed, though, a peek at the crazy-rich rainbow of Asian experience — even one as razzle-dazzlingly too-much as this one — feels not just new, but way overdue.\r\n\r\n[Peter Deburge - Variety\r\n](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/crazy-rich-asians-review-1202900373/)\r\n> Don’t worry: “Crazy Rich Asians” won’t bomb, and while it won’t beat “Black Panther” either, the film is every bit as exciting in the way it takes an ethnic group that is seldom given more than one or two supporting roles per movie and populates an entire blockbuster with memorable, multidimensional Asian characters\r\n\r\n[Anne Cohen - Refinery29\r\n](https://www.refinery29.com/2018/08/206679/crazy-rich-asians-movie-review-constance-wu-love-story)\r\n> Ultimately, the film delivers as a blockbuster romantic comedy: It’s joyous, decadent, and yes, extremely predictable. But seeing new characters inhabit and thrive within a story we’ve seen countless times before is a major achievement in itself. Who said blonde-haired, blue-eyed Cinderella had a monopoly on the happy ending?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Scott Mendelsohn - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/08/13/crazy-rich-asians-review-too-much-rich-not-enough-crazy/#378d79691ed0)\r\n\r\n> For all its good intentions and potential value as a studio gamechanger, Crazy Rich Asians is frustratingly run-of-the-mill in its storytelling and overly enraptured with the second word in its title. As a glorified tourist brochure showing us upper-class Singapore, it will show you the sights and make you very hungry for local cuisine. But if you’re not someone who enjoys the mere sight of ridiculously wealthy people joying their (mostly inherited) extravagance, the Jon M. Chu-directed adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s novel is often a chore for its middle 75 minutes or so. On top of that, its core romantic pairing is one rooted in overt dishonesty and inexplicable obliviousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Robert Kodjer - Flickering Myth\r\n](https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/08/movie-review-crazy-rich-asians-2018/)\r\n\r\n> This might sound bizarre to say about a romantic comedy, but I deeply wished critics were screened Crazy Rich Asians in IMAX. Formulaic concept aside, this is a spin on the tired genre that, under the lush direction from Jon M. Chu (adapting Kevin Kwan’s best-selling novel from a script penned by multiple names) knows to focus on the aspects that separate this experience from the rest of the dirty mold.\r\n\r\n[Emily Yoshida - Vulture\r\n](http://www.vulture.com/2018/08/crazy-rich-asians-review.html)\r\n\r\n> Luckily, Crazy Rich Asians is, at its heart, a fish-out-of-water story, and it has a lot more going for it than its literal money shots.\r\n\r\n[Mara Reinstein - US Weekly](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/crazy-rich-asians-is-joyful-but-predictable-review/)\r\n\r\n> So is Crazy Rich Asians, the much-anticipated adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s novel, worth its weight in gold? That’s a yes on the opulent surface. The joyful confection is coated in a sparkly gloss, bright enough to gleam from the darkest, most cynical corner. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Carlos Aguilar - TheWrap\r\n](https://www.thewrap.com/crazy-rich-asians-film-review-constance-wu-emerges-as-a-major-star-in-culturally-rich-romantic-comedy/)\r\n> Ultimately, “Crazy Rich Asians” doesn’t need to subvert all its predictable elements, because even if we know where it’s going, we’ve never seen that story told this way.\r\n\r\n[Tim Grierson - Screen International\r\n](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/crazy-rich-asians-review/5131485.article)\r\n> To be sure, there are meaningful observations here about the ways that money warps relationships and how children struggle with their heritage. But by trying so hard to concoct a blowout party, the movie exhausts and frustrates as much as it enlightens and delights.\r\n\r\n#Video Reviews\r\n\r\n[Roth Cornet & Dan Murrell - ScreenJukies News\r\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeDQNX4bh1w)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Black and Blue',201,259,'2018-08-08 23:33:13'),('95xaoi','New poster for Chance the Rapper’s ‘Slice’','','Domino',588,82,'2018-08-09 11:14:49'),('95xj0l','Alamo Drafthouse To Re-Release Wes Anderson\'s ‘Isle of Dogs’ on August 26, 2018 for National Dog Day','','Cats',530,75,'2018-08-09 11:40:43'),('95ztyg','Sonic the Hedgehog Movie Adds MCU Veterans Adam Pally, Neal McDonough','','Sonic the Hedgehog',6,9,'2018-08-09 15:55:29'),('960s4i','Ed Skrein Joins Roland Emmerich’s World War II Film ‘Midway’','','Midway',20,9,'2018-08-09 17:42:54'),('962rbu','Why did they change the songs from Deadpool 2 in the extended version???

The Beast also bends a metal rod but seems to have a much harder time of it. Of course, he\'s also pulling side to side instead of straight backwards like Dunn. But he gets shot by a shotgun and is actually wounded, albeit mildly, whereas David Dunn is in a train wreck that kills absolutely everyone else on board and he isn\'t even scratched. That was clearly more damaging than a shotgun blast. Again, though, the Beast is shown climbing ceilings upside down while David clearly can\'t do that. So, who will be stronger in the next movie? Is the Beast physically stronger where David Dunn is more impervious to damage? I don\'t want either character to die (because the Beast houses sweet characters like Kevin and Barry) but I would rather David survive out of the two of them since he does a lot more good in the world.

Would you help me kill him?”\r\n\r\n“...Pardon me?”\r\n\r\nFright Night follows Charlie Brewster, a horror movie loving teenager who realizes his new next door neighbor is a vampire. He tries to warn everyone, but no one believes him and blames his paranoia on his obsession with vampire movies. Now it’s up to Charlie to defeat his murderous neighbor before he kills all of his friends.\r\n\r\nWatching Fright Night reminds me of Scream a little bit, though the former came out 10 years before. In Scream, much of the humor comes from the characters knowing all the cliches of slasher movies and using that knowledge to fight the killer. In Fright Night, the characters learn all they need to know about vampire lore from the movies that are playing on the TV. A notable difference is that this movie offers more praise than ridicule for the genre while Scream is the opposite. To me, it makes the movie feel a bit more wholesome. \r\n\r\nThe two best characters here are the vampire Jerry and the the TV host Peter Vincent. Jerry is a devilishly charming and handsome monster played by Chris Sarandon, who you may remember played Prince Humperdinck in The Princess Bride. What’s great about this guy is that he manages to be seductive and menacing at the same time. Even in the scenes where he’s charming and  pleasant, you can just feel the evil emitting off of him. As for the character of Peter Vincent, he is probably the biggest tribute to 50s Hammer Horror out there. A former actor who had played Peter Cushing-like roles such as vampire hunters, he is now a TV host for late night movies just like Elvira, and surprise surprise, his show is called Fright Night. Vincent is a slightly cynical man who lacks any charm and is kind of a douchebag. He’s requested by Charlie to help him defeat his neighbor, even though Peter doesn’t believe in vampires and is just scamming the kid. What’s great is that he isn’t just some big homage to horror, he is a genuinely interesting character that draws all of your attention despite being scummy. \r\n\r\nThe movie is scary, but not the overtly serious overbearing dread kind. It’s kind of like you’re being scared, but you have a smile on your face as you watch, if that makes sense. I would also describe it as deliciously spooky.\r\n\r\nGreat vampire flick, scary and fun the whole way through, goes great as a double feature with The Lost Boys. 10/10\r\n\r\n*Welcome to Frrright Night...FOR REAL*','Late Night',532,127,'2018-08-12 13:34:38'),('96re4b','What was the best film you watched this week?

David Lynch: Have you ever loved every single quantifiable aspect of a movie(and the movie overall) whilst feeling completely lost and not understanding anything out of it? No? Well, neither have I… until this movie. To give some context, I have watched *Eraserhead* and later on everything *Twin Peaks* up until Season 3(that is to say that I haven’t watched the latest season yet). Having watched *Twin Peaks*, I feel like I have it just a little bit easier identifying some aspects of this movie, but overall I’m still left very confused, but in a good, exciting kind of way. Everything about this movie, and I truly mean everything is through the roof. The two main actresses are great in their roles and give a lot of depth to their characters and Angelo Badalamenti’s score not only rivals that of *Twin Peaks*, but imo surpasses it as one of the best that I’ve ever head. I don’t know how to describe my feelings about this movie as like I said, I’m very uncertain what it is about. Is it a love story? A story about identity and what makes us who we are? Jealousy? Uncovering Hollywood? Was Naomi Watts playing different characters or was there a literal world within the blue box? Or was it a dream?? Who knows, and honestly, I’m not sure that it matters. What it is for me however is one of the best 2.5 hours that I’ve seen. Every single scene, and I mean pretty much every single scene kept me engaged, because either was funny, intriguing, lovely, cute, scary or all of the above. I know it sounds like a big cliché, especially when it comes Lynch, but it feels like a weird dream, of which you can only remember moments and bits. I don’t know what to say, I almost want to scream in joy, because it’s the only thing that comes to my mind, this movie feels alive, like its own living thing. I’m sure a lot of the ideas are scrapped versions of what Lynch had planned for the TV show, but at the same time I can’t help but feel like there’s a purpose behind everything(even if there really isn’t, although we can never know). In this state of confusion and mind-fuckery(sorry hate that word but it feels appropriate here) I would usually want to read and watch about 1000 theories to try to get the hang of it, and maybe I will, but for now I’m just left with this feeling of instantly wanting to re-watch it again. 10/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94tb6u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e3nmlor/)\r\n\r\n* [**The Mist** (2007)—Dir: Frank Darabont. Caught this on AMC last night and surprisingly found it really engrossing. What makes the movie terrifying is moreso the monsters living within ourselves than the ones we face outside. Not incoincidentally, “the walking dead” marathon was coming on after that, and for fans of the show, if you have not seen the movie, it will seem very familiar to you based on recognizable faces and themes. The action and mystery are emotionally gripping, and I found myself engaging more and more with the story long after the credits furiouslyrolledsotheycouldgettotheNextshow...? Great performances by Thomas Jane, William Sadler, & Marcia Gay Harden chews up every ounce of food stockpiled on the supermarket shelves with her performance. Interesting to note, Darabont always preferred to release the movie in black and white as a homage to “night of the living dead,” but the studio made him shoot in color as a compromise. I know they released a B&W version in the blue ray. Look forward to watching that version as I can see what he was aiming for after finishing the movie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94tb6u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e3nprqy/)\r\n\r\n* [Finally after a month off I took use again of my moviepass for one of the local cinemas, and decided just to go and see whatever film was playing at that time of the evening.

The story revolves around the lives of immigrants (2 in particular) from Myanmar who\'ve made trip into Thailand hoping for a better future for themselves. Besides it being a beautifully shot film with a personal story to tell it really hit me on a broader scale. That being the universal right for everyone to have atleast a decent way to live their lives, and how awful it has to feel like being treated as an unwelcome and lesser human being based on the place you were born. The situations these people get into are riddled with having to depend on the help or understanding of other people who\'s motives aren\'t exactly clear.

Then I went over my cousins house with my mother and they had also rented it on DVD. I watched a little with my cousin who was 5 at the time while my mother was with my Aunt in the kitchen. The scene that really fucked me up was when theyre watching the news about the Alien at the Birthday party, watching the Alien slowly walk accross the screen out of nowhere was near traumatizing to me.

I mean i basically go to every superhero movie and the majority of big blockbusters. But no matter what every-time I leave big blockbusters and superhero movies feeling a bit empty. Why? Because while I know there will be more and we will continue with the same characters we wont be returning to the same story. I love Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings because they are one big story told through a span of numerous films and man it was satisfying when those franchises ended. Why? Because we spent years devoted to this one story and finally we got to see it end and the endings respectively were EPIC. I just find a story told over a spanned over numerous movies so much more entertaining and rich than a trilogy or series that has numerous movies but each film stands alone on their own with only the character ark and themes being the main thing that links the movies together. This is no hate to those series like the MCU and co. I love them, I truly do if i didn\'t love them i wouldn\'t go to everyone of their films opening weekend. I just find myself missing a franchise that tells one story over the span of a numerous movies because I just find it so riveting and entertaining. I MISS IT SO MUCH. The Hobbit wasn\'t the same mainly because it didn\'t need to be a series... But hopefully Fantastic Beasts can give me this, the first one was promising and a good introduction to this new setting, time period and characters and its respective themes that will carry on throughout the films. I see heaps of potential in the series to tell a good story over the span of five films. Hopefully JK Rowling improves on small things that harmed the first Fantastic Beasts like the tonal problems. That was expected considering it was her first screenplay and I only suspect her to get better. \r\n\r\nThis whole story lasting over numerous films thing is probably why i really enjoyed Infinity War because I knew that was only the first part of a story and it just got me more excited for the next one while other marvel films leave me not demanding a follow up right away.

As why would you spend money on vehicle fuel/public transport to travel to the cinema to buy a £5-15ish ticket (and of course bring your own junk food ;D as their food is daylight robbery) when you can buy a monthly movie streaming pass and binge on your sofa and have ease of access to all your munchies and drink as you want in your comfy warm home.\r\n\r\nI live near Manchester in the UK and I loved the AMC Great Northern Cinema, it\'s just bang next to the Deansgate Castlefield Metro-Link , the employees were great, so funny and easy to talk to and resolved issues speedily. But now Odeon have bought the place, their employees just look bored  and miserable/depressed (Odeon kept most of the old staff but some left) but a few are nice, one of the ticket counter guys has been their for years and I love that he stayed as I like his service. Ticket prices have tripled at the beginning of this year (with AMC most films after a week or two were £5-8) with Odeon charging mainly £7-15 per ticket on big budget films even after it\'s been in the cinema for 3 weeks. When Odeon took over they said that the prices would stay the same till the end of the year and I knew they would triple them as they have a Cinema in the Trafford Centre and it\'s stupidly expensive unless you use the Meercat movies service.\r\n\r\nI now scroll down the film listings and see 90% of the films are just movies made for some quick cash for the creators of it, movies that are stereo typical scare, action, romance or coming of age movies. And if I do see something that peeks my interest (which is super rare now) I just don\'t want to travel all the way there just to pay a expensive price as it just tastes sour (so to speak) when watching the paid for film. I think the only two movies I have truely liked this year is A Quiet Place (reminds me of The Last of Us) & Isle of Dogs.\r\n\r\nI use to love sitting with my feet up on my chair in the cinema with a big packet of ready salted crisp sticks pressed against my chest to munch on and to drink a smuggled pack of 4 Magners ciders while I got lost in the film. But now I have lost that as the cinema just doesn\'t have the good feeling to it anymore. I miss AMC owning the place, I use to see 3-4 Movies a month but now I barely even see one.\r\n\r\nWhat do you the community think of cinemas and how they have changed?

The new film, which currently has the bland working title Terminator, will be helmed by Deadpool director Tim Miller and will see the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger and surprisingly Linda Hamilton, which is interesting that she used to be married to Cameron and that was supposed to be one of the reasons why she didn’t star in Terminator 3.\r\n\r\nSo we’ve got 2 classic movies and 3 sequels that range from mediocre to absolutely retarded. Now I really despise the idea of ignoring sequels that have already been made and choosing which movies your film will be a sequel to, which the new film will do by only being a sequel to the first two. I mean, the other films exist whether you like it or not and we paid to watch them, and it’s become increasingly common for film-makers to pick and choose which movies are canon in their universe and which are not. I was thinking to myself that you can’t turn back time, but then I thought, hang on, with the terminator films, you can turn back time. If there’s any film franchise where certain entries can be written off and ignored as alternate universes it’s this one. \r\n\r\nA handful of writers have been assembled to pen what will be the first in a trilogy which, funnily enough, is what the film makers of the last two terminator movies said also. Still, as much as I don’t want to look forward to the film, I can’t help but be intrigued, more because Cameron is on board than anything else. I do wonder what story they’ll cook up and how they’ll push forward a franchise where, as Jim himself once put it, ‘the soup has already been pissed in’.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of Hamilton, I’m guessing it will focus on a present day adult John and grizzled Sarah as they fight more killing machines that get sent back though time. Surely that won’t be it so they’ll have other major story elements planned as well. Unlike say with Alien or Predator I don’t really think there is some great mythology or lore that can be bastardized and ruined, sending fanboys for their pitchforks. The only thing I can think of really is the ongoing debate as to whether you can actually stop judgement day in the movie’s universe. Because of so many avenues to explore and the fact that the film seems to be driven through a creative drive as opposed to a financial desire, I’m looking forward to see with they’ve got up their sleeve.\r\n\r\nFor sure, something that Terminator fans have been clamouring for is a full scale movie of those war scene flashbacks in the first two. Salvation tried something in that vein but it was bland and boring, genisys had several scenes set it the future ware but the blue tint, practical effects, dirty and macabre feel were all gone. The door is still open and providing there is a good set up and story I see no reason why a Terminator film partially or fully set in the future war couldn’t be great. Perhaps this film will cover the transition of normal life to the war being initiated, although that would be re-treading ground covered in T3. Cameron did mention updating the Terminator universe for the 21st Century. I wonder if that means exploring the use of drone attacks in current warfare, the increasingly-advancement of AI and things like that. I was reading up on artificial limb replacement and daydreamed of a rich society where people willingly have their limbs removed to replace them with more efficient machine counterparts, which are secretly controlled by some shady group who use it to eventually control the people. \r\n\r\nSince we know so little about the film the only thing we can really ponder on is the fate of John and Sarah Conner. It’ll be interesting to see if the new film treats them as losers, yelling at clouds that the machines are coming and becoming drunks. Maybe they naively feel they stopped the rise of the machines and live like normal people. Surely though with the ending of the second they will be doing all they can to prevent anything resembling a machine uprising, preparing endlessly for decades.\r\n\r\nYou what I thought was a cool idea to have in a Terminator film? If they had one set in the future during the war, they could have John Connor and other generals lead the fight against the machines. Running parallel to the main plot, the humans become increasingly motivated by Connor, who uses his knowledge gained from the second film to find holes in the machines’ understanding of things and utilize this to win battles. \r\n\r\nWhat I thought it would be cool to do is have them kill John Conner, and because the people around him know the resistance would be devastated, they make out that he is still alive, having an impersonator give orders through the radio or something. Someone else would stand in and call himself John Connor, and maybe even he would die, after which someone else would replace him. This way John Connor, instead of being an actual person who helps defeats the machines, is actually an idea, a beacon of hope, a source of inspiration that the resistance can use to drive themselves. And Skynet just keep on sending terminators back to kill John both though the time machine and in the present war and maybe they even succeed but they cannot understand why he keeps surviving, because the machines cannot understand the very concept of hope, the fact that Connor isn’t a person but an idea. And because they have concentrated their forces on ending Connor Skynet leaves important facilities venerable and then the Résistance seizes on the opportunity to destroy them and thus ending the war, or swinging it in the humans’ favour. Although I have to say I don’t like the idea of a central hub controlling the machines, they are much scarier if we know they won’t just plop down dead Phantom Menace style if a building explodes. \r\n\r\nI think Terminator Salvation was going to try something like this before the ending got leaked and they changed it. Originally Connor would have perished and his likeness would have been placed onto Sam Worthington’s machine character, with everyone thinking that was the real Connor. The difference between this story and mine is that this fake Connor would have then gotten into the Resistance base and shot everyone up, winning the war for the machines. Sounds pretty ballsy, but the ending we got was a lot more generic.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think – what direction should they take the terminator movies in, do you want to see an all-out war movie or more time travel complication? Or maybe you want the series ended full stop.

The film is dark and messy and full of tough decisions. Watching some of the early scenes in Helene\'s house and just seeing how horrid it is, along with the looming presence of the crime that\'s been committed there is incredibly atmospheric. The gut punch of the second act between the botched exchange and then the unspeakable horror that was the crack den is so well executed at, subverting expectations, all leading towards the twist that sets up the third act. And the note that the film ends on, one of the most challenging questions a film has posed to it\'s viewer. Sure there are films that objectively end worse, with characters who commit greater horrors, or settings left in greater disarray, but something about the irreversiablity of Patrick\'s decision seems all the more bleak. Definitely recommend, fantastic cast, riveting plot, and gritty direction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cf0vd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e5a9ab6/)\r\n\r\n* [Only got to see one film this week, but it was a good one! **Chinatown** (1974) — Dir. Roman Polanski. It isn’t until towards the end you start understanding what the “point” of *Chinatown* is. It is unlike any other detective “noir” that I’ve seen. Its R rating allows it to have a screenplay and portrayal of violence without holding back anything. It tells a brilliant story about corruptions, and how the wealthy and powerful have to much power and influence, and no moral guideline to go with it, which obviously hurts the guys at the bottom. But one thing in particular that caught me, much like in *Rosemary’s Baby* which is the only other Polanski that I’ve seen, this movie deals with the subjugation of women. It doesn’t hold back on that front and not only tell about the incestuous sexual violence done against these women, but doesn’t hold back on showing the violence against them either. That very tragic ending with the line “Forget it Jake, it’s Chinatown”, reinforcing the fact that the same thing happened in the past with Jake, and that he will always remain powerless to stop it in the face of all the corruption… The ending is not nihilistic per se, much like *Rosemary’s Baby*, it shows it how it was and doesn’t hold back, it just so happens it used to be (and to a degree still is) a very dark reality. 9/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cf0vd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e5acmoc/)\r\n\r\n* [**Call Me By Your Name** (2017). Finally got around to seeing it for a second time (at home this time) after my initial viewing late last year at the local theatre. And I’m glad it held up as one of my favourites from the last few years. While the portrayed relationship and affection is between two men it’s more on the development of a relationship at that age than it is about the homosexual aspect of it. Ofcourse that aspect adds something to the story, but its strength lies in the wonderful chemistry between the two main characters growing closer together. The comradery and sensuality between them felt very sincere, and it was a joy to see how the interaction between them constantly changed in its dynamic but inevitably becomes more raw and honest. Besides the fantastic acting of both Chalamet and Hammer the supporting roles are filled in greatly aswell. I was once again very touched by the speech near the end of the film by the main characters father (played by Michael Stuhlbarg), even while I knew what was coming. The sentiment of this speech is wonderful on its own, but also lays bare the attitude both his wife and himself have when it comes to the development of their son. They are definetely his parents and there for him, besides that he’s his own person and free to find out what  is out there for him. Loved the soundtrack aswell, and the beauty of Northern Italy is a great lovation for this story to take place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cf0vd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e5adsm1/)\r\n\r\nFor further expansion of the rules, [please read this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ygm2i/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dugffbn/).\r\n\r\nHave fun and play nice!','Little Women',65,198,'2018-09-09 13:30:06'),('9eji6e','I saw the world premiere of Mid 90s Jonah Hill\'s directorial debut at TIFF','This isn\'t a review I just wanted to share my experience with everyone on here.

The film, intended to turn The Predator series from cult favorites into a major event series, had the worst live-action debut for a film in 4,000 theaters, beating previous winner The Mummy\'s record by $7M less. That $24M opening is also just under the the $24.7M opening of the 2010 film Predators but The Predator carries a budget well over 2x that of Predators and has a much more major marketing budget. It also scored a terrible C+ rating on Cinemascore and was critically savaged so don\'t expect great legs to save this one either. Also didn\'t help the film came right as the East coast was hit by Hurricane Florence. If there\'s one film this opening most resembles it\'s the 2015 film Fantastic Four. Both are films that attempted to relaunch a franchise but studio troubles and creative infighting created messes of movies that ended up opening terribly and getting C+ Cinemascores. At least Fantastic Four though didn\'t have to deal with openly casting a sexual assaulter, so...that\'s something. Even before the major controversy everything about The Predator\'s production seemed to be a nightmare. Shane Black, who is not only a very popular and acclaimed writer/director but also acted in the original Predator, was brought on alongside his old writing partner Fred Dekker to bring this franchise back to life. However it\'s clear that while Shane Black thought he was making a Shane Black movie, the man who hired hi, John Davis (who\'s produced every Predator film), thought he was making a John Davis movie. The result by all accounts was a nightmare shoot including an entire rewrite and reshooting of the final action sequence after poor test screenings which ballooned the budget to $88M (and could be more like $100M+ before tax breaks).\r\n* **The Predator (2018) (cont.) -** Then of course just a week before the film was to come out it was revealed that one of the stars of the film Olivia Munn discovered a small role in the film was played by Steven Wilder Striegel, a register sex offender who tried to lure a teenage girl online in 2010. Even worse Striegel was Black\'s friend who he gave the role to, he failed to inform the cast and crew of his conviction, and the role was of a leering harassing man playing opposite Munn who has been vocal about her own abuse in the industry. The blowback was quick and while the scene was cut Black did little to mitigate the situation by first defending his choice and then apologizing a short time later. These sorts of controversies are always tough to gauge on the actual performance of a film but it certainly did the film no favors, not to mention a potentially brewing controversy over the film\'s bizarre treatment of autism. More importantly these controversies tarnish what little hope there was for the proposed two sequels to be directed by Black. Now The Predator just sits there, a $88M headache that just keeps getting worse. Maybe it\'ll scrape up enough overseas to get past the point of profitability (with an a reported $120M P&A budget I doubt it) but this whole experience should be a warning sign. Some franchise just aren\'t meant for the big time and maybe turning them into the next big thing isn\'t your responsibility. Maybe you should just make a good movie first.\r\n* **A Simple Favor -** It\'s always interesting when a director suddenly changes course on their career and even more interesting when they do it as quietly as Paul Fieg who\'s latest film A Simple Favor opened at #3 with a solid $16M. Fieg who is notable as a director of big female driven studio comedies like Bridesmaids and Spy decided to follow-up a similar headache inducing production and controversial film that didn\'t do very well commercially, Ghostbusters (2016), with a much smaller $20M mystery-thriller film. The elegant throwbacky posters and trailers really don\'t play up Fieg at all, instead focusing on the major cast trio of Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, and most notably Henry Golding as this is just his first film to come out after his major debut in Crazy Rich Asians (well done him on having his first two films ever being in the top five at the same time). However that wattage didn\'t really translate to a huge opening and with okay to solid reviews and a B+ Cinemascore this one just isn\'t going to quite capture that Gone Girl/Girl on the Train beginning of fall magic. A film like that needs a really big splashy debut in some way and this is all just too muddled and quiet to really go anywhere. It will also probably be a blip for Fieg who has such major studio headache inducing titles on his upcoming roster like The Heat 2 and Play-Doh: The Movie (god I wish that last one was a bit).\r\n* **White Boy Rick -** It\'s quite something that almost thirty years after Goodfellas came out so many films are still trying to be the next Goodfellas. Well it seems White Boy Rick probably won\'t be it, or at very least will have to find its audience outside of the multiplex because the latest true crime film epic opened to a pretty weak $8.8M at #4. The film tells the true of Richard Wershe Jr., who became a major hustler as a young teen and ended up being the youngest FBI informant ever at the age of 14 before ending up with a life sentence for dealing cocaine. While Rick is the main protagonist played by newcomer Richie Merritt, the big name draw was Matthew McConaughey who plays his father. McConaughey has had a tough time recapturing the magic of his 2010-2014 run with major bombs like The Dark Tower and Free State of Jones and never-was like Gold and Sea of Trees. Unfortunately with middling reviews and a weak opening I don\'t think this will be the one. It\'s also at an interesting time for its director Yann Damange who by some accounts was set to direct Bond 25, then was fired when Danny Boyle came on, and now may be rehired after Boyle\'s exit. That\'s kind of the thing with this film, it\'s probably more notable as a moment in three careers but as an event itself it really just isn\'t much of anything. Classic September release.\r\n* **Unbroken: Path to Redemption -** There\'s something about bizarre sequels no one asked for that fascinates me. Max 2, S. Darko, the endless VOD Jarhead sequels. Who makes these and why is often interesting but hard to figure out. So when I saw a poster for Unbroken: Path to Redemption I was deeply intrigued. Who demanded a sequel to Unbroken, the film directed by Angelina Jolie that\'s most famous as a failed Oscar campaign? Well turns out the first Unbroken was actually more of a passion project for producer Matthew Baer who became fascinated by the true story of Louis Zamperini, an olympic runner who was a POW during World War II who became an evangelist Christian after he returned home from the war, in the 1980s and has been trying to get a film made since. And while Baer could get major talent for his first film the financial and critical disappointment meant for the sequel he would have to rely on that old reliable Christian movie factory Pure Flix and the director of God\'s Not Dead 1 and 2, Harold Cronk. The results as expected were par for the course for a PureFlix film: awful reviews, bad box office, and a great A rating on Cinemascore. There\'s not much to the actual box office here but it is fascinating to see these major movies take their sequels to small indie houses. Hey John Davis, maybe the next Predator movie can be about a Predator converting to Christianity. I bet Pure Flix will give you a whole $10 to make it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n​**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Malcolm is found, they get him to the Jeep, then Ellie spots the other Jeep at the bottom of this weird trench, and she and Muldoon get from the road to the bottom within minutes. They find the Jeep empty and return to the road swiftly and easily, where they take Malcolm back to base after being chased briefly by the T-Rex. Why didn\'t Grant and the kids go back up? The road is not hard to get to apparently. Ellie and Muldoon make the trip and back in just minutes. Yes, the T-Rex was still somewhere about, but the sensible thing would have been for Grant to keep the kids safe down in the weird trench until someone arrived, or get as close to the road as they could since it was just a quick jaunt away and then hide in the bushes and wait... or even check to see if Malcolm was still alive (they never saw him eaten, so there was a chance he needed help).\r\n\r\nJust the layout really is the issue with this whole set up.

It’s not had the best of reception, and rightly so. Despite the fact that I enjoyed a lot of it immensely, the film has major problems. A fair few of these you’d expect stem from the movie’s clunky production, which included a scripted ending they couldn’t film because the actor they wanted refused to be in the film, and a reshooting of the entire 3rd act.\r\n\r\nThere is a fair bit in the film to like. I enjoyed the first two acts, the sleek Rogue Predator looked cool, and unlike most I enjoyed much of the film’s comedy, most of which emitted from the ragtag heroes known as the loonies. But that’s not to say the movie is a success – out of all four Predator movies, it’s in contention to be the very worst. So how can the problems of The Predator be fixed? How could the film have been changed so that it ended up being a lot better than it did?\r\n\r\nAs someone with no knowledge of film making, no experience with the industry nor any movie-related achievements on my CV, clearly I am the best man for the job in deciphering just what could be done to improve The Predator.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the film had major issues with its story. In fact, you could make the argument that pretty much all the big issues with the movie stems from the script. The most heinous crime Black’s film commits is retconning the reason why Predators come to earth, even going as far as to replace the reason why the jungle hunter and city hunter from the first two films came to visit. They didn’t come to hunt apparently. Instead they were collecting DNA samples from the toughest of humans, in order to splice it with their own and make their species bigger and badder, which explains the inclusion of the Ultimate Predator, the toughest Predator yet, which is an indicator that the specie’s plan is working. Also, humanity is about to be wiped out by global warming and the Predators are getting ready for a planet hop as they’re looking to call Earth their new home, with us being told of only one Predator who seemingly doesn’t agree with these travelling plans.\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, there’s a whole load of crap in the story. There was nothing wrong with the Predators coming to the planet to hunt humans for sport. It made them scary, it made it terrifying that there were creatures out there that considered humans as prey to pick off for XP points. To rework this and now say, nope those guys were biologists looking for samples of the very best DNA to create hybrids is such a generic and tired plot, and something that takes away a lot from what made the Predators unique. It really looks like the film makers looked at Ridley Scott’s Alien Covenant and said, hey look, they retconned the origin of the aliens and fans hated that – let’s do precisely that!\r\n\r\nThe entire story needed reworking before they chose to start production. I appreciate they wanted to expand the lore, to shake things up, but they chose the wrong thing to shake up and it’s understandable a lot of people have sour tastes in their mouths. I was actually really enjoying the film up until the ultimate Predator got into the thick of things and talks of hybridization crops up. If the movie continued this way, what with the predator hunting down the stolen equipment, with the soldiers chasing him down, and had some kind of finale where a showdown happens, I can see people rolling their eyes at the movie’s predictability and playing safe with the story, but ultimately thinking “Hey, you know what, after the likes of Covenant and Terminator Genisys it was nice to see a sequel not change the formula, just do its thing and do it effectively.” A more streamlined, basic story could irritate fans for other reasons, but at the end of the day surely it would be than the infuriating retconning we got, providing if executed properly which I think it was for the most part until the 3rd act.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the ultimate Predator – it was crap, wasn’t it? I mean, again, the problem could be eradicated with a script rework but since they included the hybridized Predator it has to be said everything about it was horrible. The dude was done with CGI instead of a man in a suit, and though it might be due to a lack of time because of the reshoots, the effects for the Ultimate Predator were horrible. We went from the antagonist being a man in a suit to a rubbery, cartoonish giant. They should have never gone for CGI in the first place, it should have been a man in a costume and prosthetics. And if you’re asking, how would they be able to make the Ultimate Predator three times the size of a normal one with practical effects, well why does the Predator need to be three sizes of a normal one? We can relate to the horror of being hunted by a Predator because at the end of the day the creatures are somewhat relatable, they move like creatures with two arms and two legs movie. But the new one is more akin to an overgrown ogre, who for some reason has the agility of a ninja.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Predator also has two Predator dogs accompany the hunt with them. Just like with him, they are rendered with horrible CGI. And they have dreadlocks. And they play fetch. You know it’s really bad when you’re looking favourably at 2010’s Predators, but the hounds in that film were far superior to this movie’s. Again, just remove the dogs or have them less puppy-like, remove the ultimate Predator or just have him as a member of a rival clan, who’s engaged in a dogfight with the Rogue predator. What’s wrong with that? Predators touched on clan wars and that was one of the better ideas of the film.\r\n\r\nI thought the movie was casted well enough, but none of the actors really blew me away. Keegan Michael Key was pretty funny, and Boyd Holbrook did his best as the lead, but it would have been great if there were top tier actors in the movie. I think it would have made a massive impact on the film, especially since so much of the movie is focused on the humans’ fights with each other. Black chased some big names like Benicio Del Toro but couldn’t land anyone, and ultimately we ended up with a pretty lightweight cast all round. The original had Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime and Apollo Creed, the second borrowed Captain Riggs off the Lethal Weapon flicks and bought along Bill Paxton, and Predators had a pretty neat cast too featuring the likes of Adrien Brody, Danny Trejo and Lawrence Fishburne even popped up to say hello.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the fil, the most painful smack across the face for the fans, is the ending, whether the humans get hold of a pod which holds an inspector gadget style Predator suit with a weapon sticking out of every nook and cranny, delivered to help the humans fight the Predators, again rendered with horrible CGI. As I mentioned in detail in my video on the predator’s ending, this was just all wrong. You could have put anything in the pod. Anything. You could have even avoided showing us what it was if you really wanted a sequel. You could have driven fans mad with anticipation if the smoke parted to reveal a Xenomorph egg. Or you could have simply cut the teaser ending out, just remove the entire scene. It wouldn’t have affected the film in any way. Does anyone remember the days when blockbuster movies would just end, and not tease a sequel? What would be so wrong with that?\r\n\r\nYou have to wonder just how bad the original 3rd act was when the reworked one was of the worst things about the entire film.  Change this by getting rid of the Ultimate Predator, get rid of the silly Iron man suit at the end, and change the reasoning of the Rogue Predator’ arrival being to help the humans, even if he’s just he’s for a another hunt or he crashed and is trying to get back to his spaceship ala the classic hunter being hunted scenario. Maybe swap out a couple of the actors, and I think you could end up with a decent film.

Ingmar Bergman. Boy oh boy, where does one start with this film. If you think Bergman other films were bleak, then I don’t know how to describe this one, it’s like bleak on steroids if that makes any sense. It is so incredibly hard to watch and simply to much even graphically that I had to look away. It does not shy away from any graphic content and the mannerisms and dialogue of Bergman’s characters are even more exaggerated than they usually are. They behave in the most non-Swedish way they can, blunt, straightforward with no regards for privacy or personal space. Yet, there’s something that draws me to it. It is quite hard to decipher, and much like *Persona* I don’t imagine that I’ll have a clear-cut grasp of what it exactly is, but its portrayal of family misery, relationships and overall emotions and death are honest, profound and deeply touching, it makes you think about your own surrounding and relationships in general. I got to see it in theatres and I was very tired and almost sleepy in the beginning but the film managed to keep me interested and invested in the characters and “story”. I’m not sure if it’s my favorite Bergman(I think that honor goes to *Winter Light*), but I think that it might be his best. 10/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9gbw4v/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e638nu1/)\r\n\r\n* [The best film I saw this week, by default as it\'s the only one, is **Crazy Rich Asians**. And honestly, even if it wasn\'t the only film I saw this week it would probably have been the best one I saw. A bit of context, I saw that it great in the US, people had good things to say about it on Reddit, it had decent scores across the board. That\'s what I knew. I knew nothing about the story at all, I hadn\'t seen a trailer or a synopsis of the plot. And I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn\'t expecting a whole lot, and it delivered above my average expectations and built upon them. Is it clichéd? Yes, easily. However the plot points that they go through are done with style and heart. The characters are definitely a stand out, and are really helped with a good script that allows most of the characters to have a their own personality, and the great acting allows these absolutely strange characters to transition to screen. And whilst yes there are a lot of over the top characters in this film it somehow never got over the top or tiring for me. I wasn\'t a fan of the main male character at first but did eventually come around to liking him. Without going into spoilers, whilst the plot is full of clichés, I think it does well to avoid some pitfalls of the genre as well. One minor complaint I have is that there is this side story that they cut into occasionally and it was good. But it felt totally inconsequential to the entire film and the film would have been fine without it. I enjoyed my time at the cinema watching this and didn\'t regret it one bit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9gbw4v/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e633x58/)\r\n\r\n* [**Searching** (2018) dir.  Aneesh Chaganty. Re-friended. In Lars von Trier’s film, *The Five Obstructions*, he challenges a former instructor to remake a short film in multiple ways; each time with a different obstacle (i.e., each shot can only be 15 frames or less and so on). The lesson that emerges from that film, is that while initially daunting and frustrating, obstacles often lead to creative solutions that results in something far better than anything you could’ve ever deliberately planned. I mention this, because this film notably uses a structure similar to the *Unfriended* movies, where practically the entire film takes place solely through computer, video, or phone screens. This movie didn’t really go for anything innovative in terms of that structural limitation, but it played around a lot with the notion of evoking emotions by the simple act of watching words type across the screen. Seeing little pauses, or furiously writing things out and then quickly deleting them, trashing certain things, or momentarily hovering over clips or images, very easily managed to convey what particular emotions someone was feeling without any spoken dialogue. A big part of that, is because we’ve all spent a lot of time on the computer ourselves, so we\'ve felt a lot of similar things during moments of anger, shame, sadness, or regret. That was a wonderful little touch, and was a limitation that the film managed to adapt into something unique. Another creatively built segment (which will probably remind you a bit of *Up*) was the opening montage made up of a bunch of cheesily-made, home videos. I’m not going to comment on the various twists and turns of the plot, because a lot of the drama comes from the entire arduous journey that the father, David Kim (played by John Cho), has to go through in his obsessive search for his missing daughter, Margot (played by Michelle La). On a side note, John Cho seems to be in a lot of quality stuff lately, and I don’t know if it’s just coincidental timing, but he’s also part of this sort of “Asian-chic” that’s currently happening, with a lot of high-profile films starring Asians and Asian-Americans all released around the same time. Anyway, he’s solid in his role, as is the daughter Michelle in the limited time she’s given. Also good, is the role of the investigating detective, played by Debra Messing, and David\'s goof-off, stoner brother, played by Joseph Lee. Perhaps some may question the directions the story eventually takes, but I think for the vast majority of the film, it easily manages to transfix you the entire way, as we gradually learn more and more about the unseen part of Margot’s inner life--whose captured life fragments, remain scattered across the internet like haunted digital artifacts. This probably owes some debt to films like *The Searchers* and *Hardcore*, and definitely to the *Unfriended* series, but it managed to cleverly convey its emotional connections and story through the creative manipulation of its unique, structural limitations, to the extent that it ended up feeling much more like an asset than a hindrance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9gbw4v/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e64evgs/)\r\n\r\nFor further expansion of the rules, [please read this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ygm2i/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dugffbn/).\r\n\r\nHave fun and play nice!','Missing Link',78,284,'2018-09-23 15:00:05'),('9ibsb','4 out of 5 knives for 9 Movie (from DreadCentral.com).

Not for his career mind you, his latest film Night School opened to a pretty solid #1 with $28M. I\'m more worried the man has some kind of Crank 2: High Voltage situation going on where he literally can\'t stop or he\'ll die. And speaking of it\'s fitting his costar in this is Tiffany Haddish who has taken her breakout in last year\'s Girls Trip and ran with it appearing in 4 feature films this year. Both stars feel like they are in constant danger of overexposure but it seems Haddish is the more likely to feel that potential backlash. As for Night School it will be interesting to see if it plays more like a Kevin Hart film, which tend to perform around 2x multipliers, or like director Malcolm D. Lee\'s previous film, the aforementioned Girls Trip. That bad girl came out in July to $30M and became a very successful counter-programming hit crossing over $100M domestic.  Now Girls Trip had the advantage of much better reviews on its side (Night School in reverse was mostly trashed by critics) but Girls Trip got an A+ on Cinemascore and Night School got an A- so the difference is not as stark with audiences. It could hold well especially as we come to a pretty comedy free zone with the big releases being stuff like A Star is Born, Venom, and First Man. With a $29M budget the film is at least in the clear so Tiffany and Kevin please just take a nap. Movies will still be there, you don\'t have to be in all of them.\r\n* **Smallfoot -** It\'s very clear that the emerging Warner Animation Group has two kind of plays, a February play and a September play. A February play is a big release with a lot of hype, aka the LEGO Movie and the LEGO Batman movie. The others are original films (or a lesser known LEGO property) that they expect to not open as well but at least have decent holds. Such is the case for Smallfoot which at least was the best opening for the latter category at #2 with $23M. WB is clearly hoping the film makes it on scheduling and charm in hopes it can perform like 2016\'s Storks, which also opened in September to $20M+ and crossed $70M domestic. The strange thing is if Smallfoot performs the same way as Storks it too will just barely pass its budget of $80M and Storks didn\'t even cross $200M worldwide which is very likely for Smallfoot as well. It\'s interesting that WAG is performing how Illumiation was supposed to be, a studio making less expensive CG animated films who would make up the difference in box office with cheaper costs. Except Illumination has turned into a massive juggernaut and WAG is just not there yet. Smallfoot will probably make enough in home video and streaming sales to make a profit but it\'s not quite where I think WB wanted WAG to be when it started up almost 5 years ago.\r\n* **Hell Fest -** Isn\'t Hell Fest just so strange? I mean it\'s such a 1980s slasher idea but it\'s not retro in any way. It\'s just hey some teens get killed at a horror themed amusement park, go see it. Well guess most people didn\'t as the film opened pretty low to #6 with $5.5M. The film is the second horror film this year from CBS Films who\'ve decided to make the bold move from producing auteur driving dramas like Hell or High Water and Patriot\'s Day to producing ~~garbage~~ high concept but inexpensive horror including Winchester earlier this year. Obviously with a budget of just $5M that Hell Fest was always going to be an easy minor win but even opening this low and with a C rating on Cinemascore and not screening for critics just makes it all seem so...sad.\r\n* **Free Solo -** The much acclaimed rock climbing doc opened in 4 theaters this weekend to $300K which gives it a per theater average of $75,201, which beats Eighth Grade to become the best per theater average of 2018. The film tells the story of a free solo (aka rock climbing without any safety ropes) climber Alex Honnold and his attempt to free solo climb El Capitan. Produced by Nat Geo this has been a big deal for them with three years in the making and much more involved distribution release than the usual air on TV and sell to schools model. This is a pretty good opening for the film and hype could push a solid doc release. Most critics have praised the film\'s for playing like an action blockbuster (free solo climbers often die during these climbs and the film doesn\'t shy away from that) and they all say to see it on a big screen. It\'s also been a very good year for docs at the box office with three from 2018 (RGB, Won\'t You Be My Neighbor?, and Three Identical Strangers) all passing $10M domestic which is tough for any doc but especially ones in the days of streaming. With this opening it\'s very possible Free Solo could become the fourth especially if it becomes more of an event film.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n​**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

The long-in-development solo flick for one of the more popular Spider-Man baddies is clearly a picture born of compromise, one that is torn between the desire to be taken seriously as a respectable comic book superhero movie and a competing desire to openly make fun of itself. Warts and all, it stands on its own two-feet and tells a self-contained story that doesn’t make you wait for the sequel and doesn’t operate as a backdoor pilot for Sony’s alleged Spider-Verse spin-offs.

Hardy has always had a terrific screen bearing and presence, but this may be his least interesting role and performance.\r\n\r\n[IGN - Laura Prudom](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/03/venom-review)\r\n\r\n>Sadly, Venom suffers from the same lack of cohesion and rejects everything that might’ve turned it into a badass joyride in the vein of Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy. The result is a muddled hodgepodge that isn’t sure whether it wants to be comedic or take its troubled antihero *way* too seriously.\r\n\r\n[Indiewire - Michael Nordine](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/venom-review-tom-hardy-michelle-williams-riz-azhmed-1202008546/)\r\n\r\n>“Venom” is very much its own entity — one in which, for better or worse, a parasitic alien calls its host a pussy for deciding to take the elevator instead of jumping off a skyscraper and Tom Hardy jumps into a lobster tank in the middle of a crowded restaurant. This leaves the viewer with two choices: reject the parasite or let it take you over. Fight it off and you’ll have a bad time; become one with it and you may achieve a kind of symbiosis.\r\n\r\n[ScreenCrush - Matt Singer](http://screencrush.com/venom-movie-review/)\r\n\r\n>Once **Tom Hardy** bonds with this alien “symbiote,” and this goo begins to talk to him as a gravelly voice in his head (also performed by Hardy), *Venom* suddenly becomes hilarious. Hardy and his evil side trade insults. They get into slapstick fights with bad guys where Venom marionettes Tom Hardy’s body like a puppet. They eat inexplicable amounts of tater tots. It’s like if Laurel and Hardy were the same guy — and also one of them liked to bite the heads off people This is epically, fantastically weird stuff. The only thing stopping this movie from becoming an immediate cult classic is that it takes nearly an hour for Tom Hardy to go full Venom. If they’d trimmed 15 minutes out of this thing, cut right to the chase, and just piled on the Hardy, *Venom* would be unmissable Oh, that first hour. It is bad. Not fun bad. Not so-bad-it’s-good-bad. Just painful.\r\n\r\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/venom-review-tom-hardy-proves-no-antidote-thiscliched-superhero/)\r\n\r\n>Perhaps the hardest thing to process about Venom – and allow me to warn you that this is not an easy film to process in general – is the sheer ugliness of Venom himself. Sony Pictures appear to have lavished a nine-figure sum on, and are now hoping to establish an entire cinematic universe on the back of, a character who looks like someone drizzled with Creme Egg filling onto a bin bag.\r\n\r\n[Uproxx - Mike Ryan](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/venom-review-tom-hardy/)\r\n\r\n>Now, I do want to make it clear that I think *Venom* is not a good movie, but I *also* want to make it clear that I had the time of my life watching it. I think in a couple of years *Venom* could be the type of movie that sells out midnight showings as people come up to the screen and act out their favorite parts – like a *Rocky Horror Picture Show* type of thing. My point is, if you’re in the right group and right frame of mind, *Venom* is *really* fun to watch.\r\n\r\n[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/venom-review-tom-hardy-michelle-williams-1202965030/)\r\n\r\n>“Venom” is a textbook case of a comic-book film that’s unexciting in its ho-hum competence, and even its visual-effects bravura. Make no mistake: The effects can be dazzling. The alien matter splattering itself around like random tentacled liquid, the way Venom cross-breeds Spider-Man’s skyscraper-hopping agility with the Hulk’s dynamo destructiveness — it’s all diverting eye candy. But to what end? This gateway into the Sony Universe of Marvel Characters (get ready: there are 90!) may not sputter as badly as Tom Cruise’s “The Mummy,” but it could turn out to be a similar case of a franchise kickoff that doesn’t fully attain franchise liftoff.\r\n\r\n[The Verge - Bryan Bishop](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17929154/venom-movie-review-tom-hardy-marvel)\r\n\r\n>But in its finished form, *Venom* is PG-13, more devoted to humor than the more disturbing aspects of the lead character. As Eddie grapples with the symbiote infection, he parades through jokey sequences filled with physical comedy. Eddie can’t stop eating tater tots! Eddie Venoms-out at his electric guitar-playing neighbor! Eddie sits in a lobster tank in a fancy restaurant — before eating a lobster live! The film is utterly dissonant, recalling the weird camp of *Batman & Robin*, which illustrates a fundamental conflict between the presentation of what the Venom symbiote is and does and the filmmakers’ efforts to turn his story into a *Deadpool*\\-esque laugh riot.\r\n\r\n[The Wrap - Alonso Duralde](https://www.thewrap.com/venom-film-review-tom-hardy-michelle-williams/)\r\n\r\n>The neither-here-nor-there plotting is matched by the wispiness of the characters, who rarely seem to have clear-cut motivations or anything resembling depth. And that’s what makes this film such an egregious misuse of a fine ensemble. Hardy is always mesmerizing, even when the material is less so, but in “Venom” he’s finally found a project he can’t overcome by sheer talent.','Call of the Wild',3651,2842,'2018-10-02 22:25:48'),('9kyqwt','Son of Saul is probably the most gruesome WW2 movie I\'ve ever seen','There\'s not a single moment in the nearly 100 minutes that\'s happy or brings you a smile.

For sheer entertainment, this movie gets everything right.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nFirst off, the marketing was absolutely genius in its chicanery. Gave audiences just enough setup while leaving them with burning questions: Who are these people? Why are they in a bunker? Is John Goodman a Good Man? What\'s outside? And what the hell does any of this have to do with Cloverfield?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAnd the movie itself is just incredible, for its expectation pushing flair and nerve-racking intensity. Part of the reason the film was so thrilling was *because* I entered it with all these questions, and spent its quiet sections trying to figure out how it could answer them in however much of its 100 minutes were left. I went into the film thinking it was going to be a monster movie, decided it was a particularly claustrophobic thriller midway through, and left extremely confused, but entertained, satisfied, and impressed that a film could throw me for so many loops.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a fan of Winstead since Scott Pilgrim and thought Gallagher Jr. did a great job of playing the sympathetic dude, but my lord, Goodman totally knocked it out of the park with this one. Until very late in the film, I was as unsure how to react to him as the two other characters. At times he seems like a generous, out-of-touch old man, while at other times, his presence, or even the mere suggestion of it (the limited space was used to great effect in this film) is terrifying.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAnd the third act is absolutely fucking insane. I know this is a spot of contention, but I don\'t care. Those last twenty minutes were my fucking jam.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAnyway, super good movie. I\'m definitely going to watch Overlord when it comes out, and if it\'s anywhere as good as this, I\'m definitely going to enjoy it too.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSomewhat well-known fun fact: Damien Chazelle was one of the writers, and was originally going to direct the film, but dropped out to make Whiplash.','Midway',87,68,'2018-10-04 20:17:15'),('9lo27v','Official NYCC Hellboy 2019 Art Banner','','Hellboy',14386,637,'2018-10-05 12:57:03'),('9lpe6k','What\'s the best use of Slow mo in film?','So i was rewatching LOTR last night, and in The Fellowship of the Ring, that scene when Gandalf fell and Frodo\'s scream and the aftermath was in slow mo, still gets to me. so good! \r\n\r\nSo I got to thinking, slow motion in film is hard to get right. overdoit and its cringey\r\n\r\nI guess what Im trying to get at is, what film(s) has the best use of slow mo?

But as I’m sure you’ve noticed, many horror movies operate out of a very specific worldview. They tell you that the world is cruel and dangerous, that evil always wins, and that everything else- love, friendship, warmth, humanity- is pretty much meaningless. \r\n\r\nMovies like that can be good in small doses, but if I’m being honest, I can only handle about 2 or 3 of them in the same month before it starts seriously affecting my mood. If I watch one-too-many nihilistic slasher movies, I genuinely start getting a little depressed. \r\n\r\nBut I still love the genre and I still want to explore the best of what the genre has to offer. So what are some great horror films with a genuinely strong moral or humanist bent? What are some scary movies that aren’t needlessly cruel to the characters within them? What are some scary stories that feature genuinely good themes about the human condition beyond “nothing matters, you’re going to die”?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, It doesn’t have to be a “happy” horror movie (if such a thing exists). It can still have a bad ending, a dark tone, etc. I just want something that still has a beating human heart at the center of it.\r\n','Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark',6,25,'2018-10-11 09:47:09'),('9na9t3','BEN IS BACK - Official Trailer | Lucas Hedges, Julia Roberts, Courtney B.

This girl was kidnapped at a young age and forced to live in a closed shed and raped constantly. She gave birth to a son that only ever knew what the room was, with no idea what is real or not. When he is 5 years old she tells him of their situation and they plan to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sounds like had the making of a gripping movie, however the escape like 20 minutes into the movie and you never see the kidnapper again. \r\n\r\nThen I imagine the movie will be about dealing with the media circus after that, however nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThere\'s this therapist that tries to convince the girl to something, however they don\'t really explain it and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThere\'s something weird going on with the girls father, he won\'t even look at the kid (I imagine because he is the result of rape) and there\'s some other mistery about him. He leaves after dinner and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThe parents of the girl are divorced and she lives now with a new guy. He seems a bit sketchy, but he isn\'t and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nGirl gives one interview and they make her feel bad, she tries to kill herself but they get her to the hospital in time. She rest and gets better, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThe kid has problems adjusting to the world, he adjust and gets friends. Nothing had happens.\r\n\r\nThe kid wants to go to the Room again, they go and he says good bye to the furniture and the movie ends.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is this movie even about?

She compared it to the success of black panther and how it was so politically charged and successful because of its authenticity to black culture. Similarly she was postulating how something like this would play out had it been the casting of Mulan or a film rooted in Asian culture like Crazy Rich Asians. You can’t “fool” the audience with a “stand-in” lookalike as they did with the casting of Aladdin. Additionally, she mentioned that there is the marginalization and lack of representation of middle easterners in film to begin with and the only roles they actually fill are typecast terrorists etc. Young middle eastern girls/guys growing up in America might never get to look to movies and see powerful acting leads that represent them. \r\n\r\nSo there are admittedly a lot of facets and ways of understanding this discussion. My goal is to expand my horizons and learn a perspective I may not be understanding. What do you all think?

Also, the Halloween series is kind of obsessed with laundry and bed sheets.',' When you rewatch all of the *Halloween* movies in a short period of time it’s easy to notice patterns and trends persisting throughout Michael Myers 40-year killing spree.  I’d never watched the *Halloween* movies so close together, so I hadn’t noticed his limited kill set that essentially features a lot of stabbing, impaling and stabbing then lifting. I also never noticed the important part laundry and bed sheets play in the franchise. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nDuring my research I noticed an interesting trend. Movies featuring Michael Myers starting laundry machines (washer/dryer) have the lowest Tomatometer scores of the franchise. *Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (6%)* and *Halloween: Resurrection (12%)* both feature Michael Myers using washing machines or dryers to help him set traps and they make *Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers* look like a classic (Tina is misunderstood). I’m not saying these two films are terrible because they feature Michael Myers proving he knows how to work appliances. I just love that the two lowest rated movies of the franchise feature Myers using laundry machines to kill people. Michael has always been down for cat-and-mouse theatrics, but these kills dampen any fear he has over the audience because their less about “pure evil” and more about Michael Myers being a jerk who likes to set lame traps for his own enjoyment.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nFor instance, *Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (*1995) features a very weird sequence that can best be described in a list. After doing a decent amount of research I’m happy with this timeline because it accurately works around October sunsets in Illinois.\r\n\r\n1. 10:00 AM –  Debra Strode goes downstairs to do some laundry and she realizes the washing machine is broken. She had done some earlier loads, so that explains the laundry hanging up outside in the backyard that later becomes a spider\'s web of doom.\r\n2. 10:39 AM – She comes upstairs with a laundry basket and gets spooked by Dr. Loomis\r\n3. 3:30 PM – She sees Michael inside her house and runs into the backyard where she is caught up in the laundry, she manages to get free but is killed by a hatchet wielding Michael.\r\n4. 3:32 OM- Debra’s blood flies onto a nice clean sheet. - [Here is the clip.](https://youtu.be/ToIjxzwWrdY)\r\n5. 3:35 PM- Michael takes the sheet off of the line and puts it in the washing machine. He doesn’t start it yet because it’s still broken (I think).\r\n6. 4:15 PM – Tommy Doyle walks Danny Strode home and they wait for Kara Strode there, It’s unclear if Michael is in the house. He might be in the basement waiting to start the washing machine.\r\n7. 4:47 PM – Kara Strode comes home and finds Tommy and Danny waiting for her.\r\n8. 4:47 PM – Is Michael still in the basement? Is he fixing the washer so it will work later? It does work later…so I guess he fixes it.\r\n9. 5:00 PM – Tommy takes her across the street to the boarding house he lives in. Later, we see Michael standing outside so he must’ve fixed the washing machine….or needed a break.\r\n10. 7:30 PM – Abusive jerk dad comes home, the power goes out and he heads downstairs to deal with the breaker. He looks at the washing machine and opens it up to find a bloody sheet.\r\n11. 7:35 PM – He is killed. [Here is the clip (10:16). Thank you Dead Meat](https://youtu.be/t8QdJBz7Qko)\r\n\r\nThis moment potentially proves that Michael Myers can fix washing machines. I wish the fixing the washer scene would’ve been in the producer’s cut.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThe moment in *Halloween: Resurrection* isn’t as intricate or planned out. However, in order for everything to work out perfectly – certain things needed to go right. These kills take place so quickly I didn’t think a timeline was needed.\r\n\r\n1. Michael is seen on camera and two unlucky security guards go to check it out\r\n2. Michael kills a security guard named Franklin and stuffs his head in a laundry dryer\r\n3. Franklin’s partner Willy comes in behind Franklin and walks past all the dryers to inspect a particular dryer\r\n4. This dryer has the head of Franklin in it which undoubtedly wrecks the sheets \r\n5. Willy walks backwards (exactly how Michael planned) and trips over Franklin’s decapitated body (perfect placement by Michael)\r\n6. Willy is killed after Michael does a one-armed pull-up. ([the moment is at 2:30](https://youtu.be/nVu9WKPFPqQ))\r\n\r\nThis scene proves to the audience that Michael is a brilliant game planner who puts together intricate murder setups that involve decapitating a dude with a knife, stuffing his head into a dryer, and waiting for the other security guard to come in and look into the dryer with the decapitated head in it. I LOVE IT!\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow that I’ve covered the two instances of Michael dealing with Laundry,  here are some moments from the 10 films that feature laundry or bed sheets.\r\n\r\n1. Halloween (1978) – Michael stands menacingly next to some sheets that are hanging on a clothesline.\r\n2. Halloween (1978) – [He locks Annie in a laundry room](https://youtu.be/sWXKMoarMRw)\r\n3. Halloween (1978) – He cuts holes in a bed sheet to trick Lynda before he kills her. ([Clip - scene at 10:45](https://youtu.be/QfVQMYvgXuQ))\r\n4. Halloween (1981) – Laurie has flashbacks of her mother hanging white sheets on a clothesline\r\n5. Halloween (1981) – Michael stabs some sheets thinking it’s Laurie\r\n6. Halloween 5 – Jamie runs into some drying laundry in the children’s hospital\r\n7. Halloween 5 – [Jamie gets stuck in a laundry shoot](https://youtu.be/WH9XdpMzH_E)\r\n8. Halloween 6 – Michael gets blood on a sheet when he kills a nice lady.\r\n9. Halloween 6 – Michael puts the sheet into a washer (without soap). The jerky dad checks it out and is killed.\r\n10.

Upon checking the tire he see\'s that it has been shot with a bow and arrow but there is no-one around. There is another scene in a gas station when nothing much is said be he sees a woman?

I literally spent 30 minutes debating whether or not Dolph’s kick in *Dark Angel* should be considered a front kick or not (its not - [kick is at :30](https://youtu.be/SQT0GHgrI3Q)). Also, every movie viewing was a tense experience as the data teeter-tottered due to the limited number of Lundgren movies that have a Tomatometer score (16 of a possible 65). Unlike my jet ski or JCVD data the results didn’t become clear until the very end when the 0% Tomatometer rated movies *Black Water* and *The Peacekeeper* failed to feature a front kick from Dolph. The data could’ve gone either way and when you collect as much data as I do you cherish the close results that make movies like *Masters of the Universe* and *Johnny Mnemonic* exciting.\r\n\r\nThis may be controversial, but I left out *Rocky IV* because there was zero reason for Dolph to throw a front kick.  Drago may embrace steroids, but I don’t think he would dishonor himself by throwing a deadly front kick at Rocky during their boxing match. Also, how the heck does *Universal Soldier: Regeneration* not have an RT score yet? It’s a badass action film that features Dolph front kicking people. Another problem I have is the lack of love for the Lundgren directed *Command Performance*. It’s a movie about Dolph being awesome while saving the day in a “*Die Hard* in a concert venue” movie.\r\n\r\nIf you are a martial arts purist you won’t be happy with what I considered a front kick. I am well aware of the traditional front kick, however, I decided to include Teep – front push kicks and soccer kicks because they are aimed forward and there isn’t a hip turn or angled trajectory. They are straight forward kicks, and if they are done right could potentially send the victim into the next zip code. Also, the kicks didn’t have to be at humans as Dolph does front/push kick doors or large slabs on meat.  [Here is a clip](https://youtu.be/bOrZStlOJxw) from *Universal Soldier* that features Dolph kicking a slab of meat and crushing a monologue like a boss.\r\n\r\n**Here are the results.** \r\n\r\n**1. Movies Featuring Dolph Throwing a Variation of a Front Kick**\r\n\r\n* **Tomatometer Average – 34.8%**\r\n* **Inflated Domestic Box office – $66 million** (*Red Scorpion, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Universal Soldier, The Expendables, The Expendables 2)*\r\n* **The Front Kick Movies** *–* [***Red Scorpion***](https://youtu.be/iqbk5sO8MCA)*,* [***The Punisher,***](https://youtu.be/qQTkktLm2kI) *Showdown in Little Tokyo,* [***Universal Soldier***](https://youtu.be/bOrZStlOJxw)*,* [***The Expendables***](https://youtu.be/i38fhRT6kHY)*, The Expendables 2,* [***Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning***](https://youtu.be/gfZfwupXfNA)*,* [***Skin Trade***](https://youtu.be/MOEu8VReUGE)\r\n\r\n**2. Movies Featuring Zero Front Kicks** \r\n\r\n* **Tomatometer Average – 24.2%**\r\n* **Inflated Domestic Box Office – $34 million** (*Masters of the Universe, Johnny Mnemonic, The Expendables 3*)\r\n* **The movies that don’t feature front kicks** *– Masters of the Universe,* [***Dark Angel***](https://youtu.be/SQT0GHgrI3Q)*, Johnny Mnemonic, The Peacekeeper, The Expendables 3, Don’t Kill It, Black Water*\r\n\r\n**Why are the front kick movies better?**\r\n\r\nIt helps that *The Expendables* (42%), The *Expendables 2* (66%) and *Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning* (55%) have solid Tomatometer numbers and only *Red Scorpion* has a score below 10%. There really is no correlation or causation, but, it’s worth noting that Dolph’s two movies with a 0% Tomatometer rating (*Black Sea, The Peacekeeper*) do not feature front kicks. If I was putting together a Dolph Lundgren primer, four of the front kick movies would be in the five I recommend:\r\n\r\n1. *Rocky IV*\r\n2. *Universal Soldier*\r\n3. *The Expendables 2*\r\n4. *Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning*\r\n5. *Showdown in Little Tokyo*\r\n\r\nThe main reason the scores are relatively close is because the writers of *Don’t Kill It* crafted a decent script that didn’t allow Dolph to front kick a jerky demon into oblivion. The movies 89% Tomatometer score is earned, but when you write a movie about Dolph battling a demon AND you don’t have him kick it – there is something wrong with you. Why not let Dolph kick it?\r\n\r\n**What movie features his best front kick?**\r\n\r\n*The Expendables 2* is his highest rated “front kick movie” and it features (in my opinion) his greatest front kick ever. Basically, he destroys a henchman with a beautiful kick that sends him over a railing. It’s awesome ([1:55 in video](https://youtu.be/_gb6yX-Uiqk)). While watching the movie again (for research) I was shocked at how many awesome things I had forgotten. Here is a list\r\n\r\n1. Dolph front kicks a henchmen and says “Goodbye.”\r\n2. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis drive around in a smart car\r\n3. Scott Adkins and Jason Statham fight\r\n4. There is a moment when Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone share the screen\r\n5. Dolph gets to use his science background to hilarious effect\r\n6. Chuck Norris probably kills 70 people\r\n7. JCVD plays a great villain\r\n8. Dolph front kicks a henchmen and says “Goodbye.”\r\n\r\nThere you have it! Irrefutable evidence that movies featuring Dolph Lundgren throwing a front kick are better than his other movie that don’t feature front kicks.

I even watched the original the night before seeing the new one to prepare myself. \r\n\r\nI didn’t think the movie was bad per se, but I was let down a bit. Here are some things that bothered me:\r\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\r\n\r\n1) Plants with no payoff. The cold open scene establishes what is to come for the rest of the movie. In this case, the podcasters plead at Michael for him to “say something!” which got me thinking...wouldn’t it be cool if Michael spoke in this movie? It took them 11 movies to think outside the box and actually do something different in one of these movies, wow. Then they keep planting that idea throughout the movie: “he hasn’t spoken a word in 40 years” and the doctor just wants to know WHY he kills, etc. But in the end Michael doesn’t say anything... I was pretty let down by this.  \r\n\r\n2) The pacing. Everything happens extremely quick in this movie. Once Michael escapes he goes on a killing spree and quickly wracks up more bodies than he did in the first movie. Some of the kills were cool but ultimately, for me, they lacked importance because of the sheer number of them. I wish there was more stalking and lurking like there was in the original, which leads me to my next point...\r\n\r\n3) Lack of atmosphere. The original movie is full of creepy atmosphere, which is what makes it a classic! This movie had nothing like that. The feeling of voyeurism and dread from the first movie has been removed completely. We never see anything from Michael’s POV and he is always just conveniently THERE, which I know is a staple of this series but I still think it was overdone in this one. \r\n\r\n4) References to other Halloween movies. Some of these were great but, for me, it still doesn’t save the movie by adding references. Does it make the experience better? Maybe. Does it propel the movie to a level of greatness?  No. The Predator had some nostalgic references too and that movie sucked ass. \r\n\r\n5) the story lacked twists and turns. I just felt like it was too easy to stop Michael in the end. I fully expected the granddaughter to be the reason why Laurie and her daughter would have to come out from hiding in the basement, or that Laurie would have to leave her daughter alone momentarily to save the granddaughter, leaving the basement open for Michael to enter or something. Or I thought for sure the daughter would leave the secret door opener in the kitchen and Michael would figure out how to open it or something. The point is they had plenty of chances to add nail biting moments to turn all of Laurie’s years of preparing against her, but they didn’t. It just worked easily. A little bit of tug of war with Michael on the stairs and that was it!\r\n\r\n6) The new Loomis. The twist with this guy just didn’t work for me. It came off as silly. Speaking of silly...\r\n\r\n7) The comedy. While I thought the humor was funny at times, I just felt like it didn’t belong in this movie, simply because it downplays the importance and terror of a looming killer! Having said that, the little kid being babysat was probably my favorite part of the movie. \r\n\r\n8) The score. I LOVE John Carpenter’s scores, I even went to see him perform live last Halloween. The dude is a legend and I was really looking forward to this movie and one of the main reasons why was to hear his new score. And while I did think it was good in parts, overall I just felt like it was forgettable. It was obviously a retread of the original music, which is expected, but I don’t know...I just felt like I wanted more creepiness? I can’t put my finger on it exactly but I think I just desired more. Not sure if anyone agrees with me here. \r\n\r\nI had some other small nitpicks but I won’t mention those here.

They could have at least made a better movie though. \r\n\r\nAnyways I think Halloween II is a great follow up, to the 1978 one... picks up right after that one. Same Halloween night. It also does a great job upping the explicitness (Friday the 13th 2 came out the same year... one of the better F13 films). What stands out to me is Dean Cundey\'s cinematography, there were a LOT of creative and interesting shots, some much more complex than his work in the original. His longer takes here added to the creepiness so much too. The new Halloween has that one long take they made sure to put in all the trailers where it felt like they were patting themselves on the back but the editing was just atrociously quick for the rest of the film. \r\n\r\nI won\'t get into spoilers much but be careful for this next paragraph... I love the feeling of mass hysteria among Dr. Loomis and the cops; they are all jumpy, frustrated, etc. I also love the hint of a motive and backstory for Michael. I hate how everyone is saying Michael is scarier with out a backstory/motive. I think a couple hints are fine if they are done well and this movie slips them in pretty effectively. Loomis has a super dark breakthrough/monologue towards the end that I enjoyed \r\n\r\nTl; dr: Halloween II is fantastic as a follow up to the original and as an sort of campy/bloody 80s slasher. Some plot things didn\'t pay off, but it puts new ideas on the table surprisingly well. Great atmosphere, and camerawork from Dean Cundey. I think the new one really pales in comparison: choppy editing, stakes don\'t feel high, everyone\'s motives felt off, weird humor. But check out Halloween II if you\'re craving a really dark and eerie film.

While a 58% drop looks pretty steep, in terms of huge horror openings ($50M+) it\'s in the middle having a better drop than The Nun, Paranormal Activity 3, and The Village but a worse drop than IT and A Quiet Place. After this weekend the film crossed $125M domestic, becoming only the third slasher film to do so and beating Scream to become the highest grossing slasher film of all time. Despite it being a film called Halloween on Halloween weekend there still is a pretty heavy curse on the weekend itself as most people would rather go out to parties than go see films, despite a horror film usually topping the charts. Expect another rough weekend coming up as there is stiffer competition coming out including three major new wide releases. Still Halloween is doing all of this on a $10M budget and was considered a dead franchise. This is a success by any measure even if it falls off the charts next weekend.\r\n* **Hunter Killer -** God bless you Gerard Butler. I don\'t know how you get all these foreign and indie distributors to finance your insane Canon-esque films but I love ya for it. His latest bomb is called Hunter Killer which opened at #5 this week to a pretty dismal $6.6M. The film carries a pretty hefty budget for a film like this with $40M, mostly due to expensive sets including a full sized submarine exterior built at Pinewood studio\'s water tank. The film was also a holdover from the infamous Relativity Media who went bankrupt in 2016 right when the film was getting ready for release. So this turkey got shuffled from one plate to the next before being dumped on a historical mediocre weekend where it flopped. Only other thing to note, 93% of the audience was over the age of 25. Damn young kids not respecting Gerard. He\'s the reason we have democracy you ingrates!\r\n* **Johnny English Strikes Again -** I\'m not sure why Johnny English films still even get released in America other than to say they did. The latest one has reached a new level of American disinterest as it opened in 544 theaters to just $1.6M. So let\'s instead talk about the foreign appeal of JE which has always been its stronger suit. Of course the main country for these films is Latvia, I don\'t know why. No of course it\'s the UK where the previous films crossed $30M, but Strikes Again doesn\'t seem to be inspiring much devotion there either where in almost a month of release the film has yet to cross $15M. However despite lower grosses across the board the film still has crossed $100M worldwide mostly lead by the UK and Asian countries including of surprisingly Malaysia where it has grossed $5M so far. So overall not a massive hit but this is really more of a national favor to UK icon Rowan Atkinson than a big comedy play. Also, is there a more British thing in the world than a comedy film series that\'s 15 years old and has only 3 films in it?\r\n* **Suspiria -** It\'s a good time for horror remakes when even the super arty ones are making bank as the remake of the 1977 Italian classic opened in 2 theaters to $179,806, giving it a $89,903 per theater average. That beats Free Solo as the best per theater average of the year. The film has been highly anticipated for a while. For one it\'s the follow up for Luca Guadagnino who has been a steadily rising force in the arthouse world who really made a big breakout last year with his critical darling Call Me By Your Name. Then there\'s all the press surrounding the dual performance by Tilda Swinton where she\'s playing a dude who\'s playing a dude. And just the interesting element of remaking a horror classic but with a fairly feminist lens to the whole thing. All that hype worked in NYC/LA but it\'s tough to know if that will expand out. The film has had some pretty awful posters so hype will be the main factor as it expands further into 250 theaters next weekend.\r\n* **London Fields**  \\- Do you know this Amber Heard lead period drama exists? Probably not since it set a pretty crappy record this weekend as it opened in 613 theaters to just $116,470. That makes it the second worst opening ever for a film in wide release (600+ theaters). The film\'s release however feels more like lancing a boil than a classic splashy opening as it\'s a film marred by trouble. First was the film production suing Heard when she refused to do a nude scene for the film. Then there were fights between the director and the producer over who legally had final cut (the film in theaters is the director\'s cut). And then there\'s the fact the film has been in this struggle so long that Johnny Depp is in this movie as this was long before he and Heard\'s messy divorce and subsequent domestic abuse allegations. So yeah not surprising it got no marketing and no buzz whatsoever and just kinda dropped into theaters. Hell some of the lawsuits aren\'t even over yet! Isn\'t filmmaking just the most rewarding field you could ever go into?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

I just couldn\'t figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a 60 Minutes segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that killed a bunch of sheep (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, \'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was Salt Lake City.\' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called Rage, starring George C. Scott, but before it was released, I was deep into The Stand, finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named Randall Flagg. The land of Mordor (\'where the shadows lie,\' according to Tolkien) was played by Las Vegas.[3]\r\n\r\nTolkien\'s fantasy epic was pretty good. Peter Jackson did a really good job but personally I\'m not that enamored of this kind of story. I\'m reading Stephen King\'s book, the Stand, at the moment and I really want to see a movie treatment of it, but done properly. The set up for the rest of the story is extraordinarily good but the rest of it would need an expert touch for it to keep a quality of realism. It does get a little over dramatic in places but if it could be done right it\'d be a Magnum Opus for whoever pulled it off.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas for who could direct it and actors for the variety of roles? I think the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead was pretty good although I\'m kinda stuck on the 70\'s and 80\'s versions because the lower caliber writing and acting talent seemed to lend itself really well to the theme. So I think maybe Zac Snyder could pull it off.

I have to say, it’s a bad movie. I *like* bad movies, normally. I find entertainment in almost any movie. I just  told a friend I didn’t hate The Meg. I hated The Predator.\r\n\r\nIt could have been goofy fun. It wasn’t. It could have been more straightforward action. It wasn’t. It was a decent looking movie with just baffling characters and bad plot. They use the “r” word in the film and I almost feel justified in using it to describe the characters in the movie.\r\n\r\nCan we talk about autism, Tourette’s, and PTSD? Could they have not at least used Wikipedia to somewhat understand these and how they work? I can suspend my disbelief in movies, but I can’t just shut my brain and all knowledge of the known universe down completely. When they say “turn your brain off,” we can’t literally do it. That lets you dismiss some logic, not dismiss it completely.\r\n\r\nIt’s hard for me to know where to start. Let’s start with Olivia Munn’s character. I don’t give a shit about your position on strong female leads, because this film destroys that notion with impossible female leads. What starts off as science lady becomes action lady without any development AT ALL. She goes from what I think is working with service animals to Delta Force within like the first 30 minutes. Unless you’ve seen it (spoiler btw... though you can’t spoil something so rotten), it’s hard to describe how crazy her arc is.\r\n\r\nThe Crazy Crew or whatever is every action movie stereotype trope you need.  It was their quick intro and evolution into the A-Team that almost convinced me that movie was a parody of action movies, but it’s not. It’s not that far off of the Shane Black style (just quality) and I just don’t believe he’s parodying himself.\r\n\r\nThomas Jane. Listen man, why are you here? You’re better than this. At least you should have been the lead. This Tourettes thing is embarrassing. If you owed a debt to Shane, he now owes you. Big time.\r\n\r\nI need to go back to Munn for a minute. There has got to be cutting room footage of her topless in this movie. I know it has the controversy involving the pervert or pedo at the beginning that was cut, but she is naked twice in this movie for really no reason. Naked but no showing anything. She was topless in Magic Mike, so she’s up to it. There are two blown chances in this movie. I don’t care if a woman gets naked in a movie or not. That’s fine, but why tease the possibility twice when it doesn’t need to. The second time seems like it’s going to matter, but I don’t remember a payoff. I may have missed it intertwined with all the other baffling shit.\r\n\r\nVillain is the government? Well, besides the Predator who is not the villain? There is a good guy Predator who kills a bunch of scientists in the beginning. And a bad Predator who kills all the people who we like in the end once this movie remembers they have to kill them. There is also Sterling K. Brown and his sidekick. Brown goes from lead scientist who is joking around to maniacal cartoon villain yelling at autistic children... to someone who accidentally kills himself in a blink and you miss moment. His sidekick was killed by the good guy with a tranquilizer gun in the eye. Yeah, I don’t know.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I guess they were all just bad guy government in the beginning, because in the end, what I guess is good guy government takes over. It seems like the recruiting for these could get muddled in government inefficiency, but I guess it works out. All the bad guys all have pretty bad guy traits, so I guess you just have a little column A and a little column B.\r\n\r\nOh, there are space dogs. One becomes a good boi by being shot in the head. I think Munn’s skills come into play? It likes her. No real reason why.\r\n\r\nDid I mention almost all the Crazy Crew dies? So there’s one who dies from a force field that covers the alien ship. Well, except the engine that one good guy jumps into to sacrifice himself. I’m not even going to get into all the reasons this team doesn’t work. That the “their soldiers” by the main dude as a motive shouldn’t work. It comes from the Suicide Squad school of team building. It just happens because it has to. Back to the guy who jumped into the alien ship engine. Is it nitpicking at this point to point out that it seems like a turbine engine? I mean, the concept of that is not compatible with space. This really is a small detail when compared to the rest of the clusterfuck that is this movie.\r\n\r\nI’m skipping a lot of nonsense believe it or not, because there is so much fucking nonsense in this movie. Literally scene after scene that makes no sense.\r\n\r\nThere’s the stupid mom. At one point the bad government men are watching her. Her husband calls, she is not very clever and then destroys her cellphone. This is stupid and kind of a misunderstanding of the trope. They can’t do shit with HER cellphone. The idea is to destroy the one that can be traced. She also lets her autistic kid run around doing whatever, which causes the death of someone and a large explosion on Halloween. Yes, Shane Black and not Christmas. Maybe the first sign shit was off.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the movie, they did Predator call-backs. They abandoned this early or just recognizable later as the movie descended into madness. I didn’t like this perceived abandonment.\r\n\r\nLet’s just say I’m getting tired and the ending goes fairly predictably, with the reveal that everything is due to global warming and the Predators wanting to add autism to their DNA. It’s like the plot was actually written by AI by feeding it 4chan.\r\n\r\nIf we go all the way back to the good guy Predator, we find he was given us a secret weapon. The good government tells us this as we see autism kid sitting at something like a fucking soldering station working on alien tech. Munn seems to have disappeared though in every single other scene in the movie. Alarms go off and there’s a probe type thing that has a “Predator Killer” exosuit inside that terrorizes a random science dude.\r\n\r\nThis last scene kind of personifies the movie. Early on, a big deal is made how the scientists decided on the Predator moniker for these aliens. Munn points out that Predator isn’t a good name and she’s told it was voted on and “fucking badass” or something. So then at the end, the autistic kid is reading the Predator language from the OS of some alien shit (there’s some other dumb stuff involving this earlier) and says, “It has a name.” This is Predator Killer. How did this get named this by the “good” Predator that? It makes no sense given the name and timeline. This is indicative of the movie. It doesn’t even try to be logical.\r\n\r\nI’m sorry about going into all of this. If you’ve seen it, you don’t deserve to relive it. Shane Black (which I accidentally typed Shame Black and is fitting) has been one of my favorite writer/directors. I don’t understand how he made something this bad. I’m saddened and confused.\r\n\r\nI did like the music.  \r\n\r\nThe Predator: 2/10','Last Christmas',6,23,'2018-11-11 22:52:31'),('9wdt6e','Toy Story 4 - Official Teaser','','Toy Story 4',35915,2733,'2018-11-12 08:00:29'),('9wdy8k','Toy Story 4 Teaser Poster','','Toy Story 4',7923,433,'2018-11-12 08:20:43'),('9wfvxt','Editorial: ‘Toy Story 4’ And Are Teaser Trailers Dying Out?','','Toy Story 4',0,0,'2018-11-12 12:16:22'),('9wg2ot','Netflix’s Narnia Adaptations Will Be Live Action','','Good Boys',1207,170,'2018-11-12 12:36:27'),('9wj2ph','Mark Dindal Directing The New Garfield Animated Movie','','Cats',2,10,'2018-11-12 17:47:00'),('9wnxxf','Jacob Tremblay Joins Doctor Sleep\"\"\"\"','','Doctor Sleep',116,33,'2018-11-13 05:28:16'),('9wovah','Meet Ducky and Bunny in Toy Story 4, played by Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele','','Toy Story 4',22463,865,'2018-11-13 08:03:24'),('9wpao5','Alita: Battle Angel | 3rd Official Trailer','','Alita: Battle Angel',1709,691,'2018-11-13 09:02:05'),('9wsqgq','How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) vs The Grinch (2018)','Which do you guys prefer?

I\'ve enjoyed Spike Lee\'s canon for decades.\r\n\r\nHowever, as brilliant a filmmaker as I think Spike is, I think he took a cheap way out at the end of this movie.\r\n\r\nWe all know that Spike is a racially motivated filmmaker. That\'s not a secret. He\'s made that lily-white clear since the 1980s.\r\n\r\nWith BLACKkKLANSMAN, he made an almost perfect film. He delicately balanced history, drama, comedy and action. He was able to bring terrible people into the realm of believable characters. \r\n\r\nHe did an admirable job of establishing the presence of white supremacy and rooting African-American in righteously political subversion. \r\n\r\nAs far as the ending goes, he\'d made it perfectly clear that the Klan had lost that particular battle. The penultimate scene showing Ron and Patrice seeing the Klan rally and the burning cross shows that that battle was won, but the war is far from over.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, would Spike show the Charlottesville footage? I get the social/political/cultural statement. I have no issue with that.\r\n\r\nMy issue is, why would one of the best storytellers in America revert to that? It makes no cinematic or artistic sense.\r\n\r\nHe\'d have been much better off ending with the upside-down American flag.

Basically there could be an amazing prologue like in fellowship but this time showing the creation of middle earth by the Valar, and then some more exposition to setup the world and go through the first age of middle earth. \r\n\r\nBut the bulk of the trilogy could be nicely mapped out to the trilogy of books based on the Silmarillion that has recently been published in its entirety by Christopher Tolkien. So the movies could roughly parallel all three of these books that expand on the Silmarillion stories: Children of Húrin, Beren and Lúthien, and The Fall of Gondolin. \r\n\r\nAlso the timing couldn’t be better seeing as Christopher Tolkien has always prevented this from happening, but he has recently stepped down from the Tolkien Estate so can’t stop it anymore. \r\nhttps://screenrant.com/lord-rings-christopher-tolkien-retirement-peter-jackson-silmarillion/\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?

While I\'m not really a fan of musicals, I also gotta admit the songs here are pretty endearing, especially *Hakuna Matada*.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I have with this movie is how the entire hyena species is seen as evil. It makes me feel like Scar was actually doing something okay by taking in the hyenas, a species completely oppressed by the rest of the animal kingdom.

But, that wasn\'t the case. \r\n\r\nDon\'t get me wrong, I really liked the film as a guilty pleasure. But, on the gore side of things, it immensely disappointed me. There was nothing even remotely brutal in it, the worst I could think of was that soldier getting his head bashed in (which you see in MA-15 movies all the time). And I guess Wafner\'s injury is also pretty sick, but other than that, I barely saw any gore. The opening scene and the head explosion moment were done so quickly that I could barely even catch a glimpse of the grotesque imagery. \r\n\r\nSo, how did it secure an R-18 rating? Keep in mind that an r-18 rating is the equivalent of an NC-17 rating in the US. It\'s even harsher than bbfcs 18 rating. If a film gets an r-18 rating purely for violence, you know you\'re going to see some really fucked up shit. Only the most obscene of movies secure such a rating. The Predator (the one from this year) is ten times more violent than Overlord, yet it only secured an MA-15 rating. Even the 2018 remake of Suspiria, which has some of the most brutal and sexual scenes I\'ve seen put to film, has an MA-15 rating. \r\n\r\nWas there something in the film that offended the ratings board so much, they had to slap that rating on?

Isn\'t a trilogy enough?','Most people would go by the notion that if a movie were to have more sequels, a trilogy would be perfect. A successful franchise with three instalments overall would already feel complete and most likely would not overstay their welcome. Good examples would be the original Star Wars trilogy, the Back to the Future trilogy, the original Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Toy Story trilogy. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUsually in a trilogy, the first film would establish the setting, theme and characters. The second film sets all the action and complications, and finally, the third film brings the story to the climax and to an ultimate conclusion. However, like most successful franchises, Hollywood may milk a franchise to the point where it gets worse and overstays its welcome. This is usually done by adding a fourth film to an already complete and perfect trilogy. The thing is, the fourth film after a complete trilogy tends to be the black sheep of the franchise, as it isn\'t praised as much as the previous instalments.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAn example of this would be Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The original three films from the 80s were an excellent look of the adventures of Indy. However, as Harrison Ford had gotten much older by the 2000s, the magic had seemed to be absent, leaving us with a feeling that the fourth film was more of a cash grab than something that could have worked as a decent followup to the Last Crusade. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow that Toy Story 4 has been announced, I have a lot of concerns. Even though i\'m confident that it won\'t be godawful, since this is Pixar we\'re talking about, most of us can agree that Toy Story 3 was a perfect conclusion to the adventures of Woody and Buzz, even leaving a lot of us in tears. I just don\'t want this ending up to be a mediocre cash grab like most of Illumination Entertainment\'s stuff (they\'re making a minions and secret life of pets sequel, wtf). \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo the question is, are there any fourth instalments in a franchise that are actually decent, or should a trilogy be enough for a movie franchise?','The Secret Life of Pets 2',24,145,'2018-11-18 04:02:32'),('9y75zv','A day late: ‘Duck Soup’ released 85 years ago yesterday','','Yesterday',150,11,'2018-11-18 11:13:40'),('9yb0jj','Can the mods stop cherry picking movie discussions and just post one for each wide release?','Over the past few months I’ve noticed that the mods seem to be skipping over discussion threads for a certain type of film, like Instant Family this weekend.

Looking for a place to discuss movie plots again after the demise of IMDb forums. I hope this is the place. I read the rules beforehand so I don’t think I’m breaking any.\r\n\r\nI want to discuss an aspect of the end of Ex Machina, SPOILERS ABOUND.\r\n\r\nAfter Ava has killed Nathan, she sees Caleb on the floor waking from consciousness. She asks him “Will you stay here?”, which for the first three viewings I assumed meant the entire complex. But this time, I think what she meant was *that very room*. It is in a room adjacent to her changing room where she is about to get completely naked. Between the two rooms is only glass, with several trees slightly obscuring the view, but it is very easy to look through the leaves. It’s the perfect creeper location if you wanted to watch.\r\n\r\nAnd watch he did. The movie has five takes showing him watch her every move through the trees. You can even see him in the reflection of the mirror spying through at her. And Ava takes note early on, both by looking behind her at him and clearly seeing him in the mirror.\r\n\r\nNow I get that she is an android so she doesn’t have a concept of “naked” per se. But she does have all the knowledge of BlueBook, and she knows that it is objectively morally wrong to watch a woman change without her consent. \r\n\r\nWhether she had any plans to bring him out with her prior to that situation remains unknown, but perhaps after seeing him act so disgusting she decided to leave him as he was likely only lusting after her instead of actually caring for her. But maybe someone has a better reason they could share with me?\r\n\r\nWhat’s sad is, Nathan designed her using Caleb’s porn profile on BlueBook, so she is simply a sex object in Caleb’s mind. It was therefore extremely tempting for him to try and see her naked in that moment. The “Will you stay here?” was a moral test that Nathan set him up to fail.  \r\n\r\nEDIT: After reading some ideas better than mine in this thread, I have adapted my opinion above. I don’t think it had to do with morality as much as it was her keeping him in one spot so she could escape without him stopping her. I’ll start my fifth viewing and then return and report later.

I was just curious how that shoot’s been going, and how it might differ from your previous collaborations with Quentin.\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON: It’s a very close relationship right now, we’ve been through numerous films. I think it’s going to be, no jinx, but I think it’s going to be a fantastic film. It’s something extremely unusual and rare, it’s been going very well. It’s tumultuous of course, there are harder days than others, even when you have more days. I’m on day 89 right now, so when you think that you’re day 89, almost 100 days, and I just finished a film in 36 or 37 or whatever it was. It feels as if it’s supposedly luxurious, but you find it is not quite as luxurious as you would anticipate.\r\n\r\nAlso the caliber of talent on screen, that cast is just insane.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON: Insane, it’s beautiful. To work with Leo together with Brad …\r\n\r\nIs it exciting to frame up a shot with two movie stars as huge as Leo and Brad in the same frame?\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON: Yeah! It’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, contemporary versions. These are two massive stars, and talented, and Margot [Robbie] is also phenomenal and wonderful to be around. There’s a number of people that you’ll see within the film that haven’t had as much exposure, that are remarkable. We’ve got Dakota Fanning in the movie, and she is—man is she a powerhouse. It’s a great cast.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the tone of it, because it seems like a really big piece that’s taking on a lot.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON: It does, and I think the tone of it is difficult to describe, because it’s very fresh. It oscillates between humorous, serious, spooky; it’s playful, it’s not easily describable, but it’s very, very Quentin. Of course Al Pacino was in it, you’ve got remarkable monologues, but you also have remarkable small set pieces. It’s going to be a tremendously unique film.\r\n\r\nThat’s great. You guys shot on 70 mm for Hateful Eight, is there anything special in store for audiences on this one, cinematography-wise?\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON: Not in terms of lensing, we’re doing anamorphic 35, but we didn’t trespass into the 70mm realm for financial reasons principally. The budget, there are a hundred sets or something, so they needed to cut back somewhere, and the added cost of 70 is quite remarkable. And it also has tremendous limitations, like no zooms. And Quentin wanted zooms in the film, so it required us to go to the 35 anamorphic.','Once Upon a Time in Hollywood',24,19,'2018-11-20 00:00:07'),('9yphx3','THE INTRUDER - Official Trailer (HD)','','The Intruder',0,0,'2018-11-20 01:21:41'),('9ypnxo','Ron Perlman\'s Thoughts on the New Hellboy','','Hellboy',0,17,'2018-11-20 01:45:28'),('9ypu9g','Disney and Pixar Animation Studios have used the \'good guy is bad guy whole time\' twist at least 9 times','Just off the top of my head, Disney and Pixar have used the \'GASP!! the good guy is actually the bad guy the whole time!\' twist a lot.

Particularly horror films which by no means are perfect - far from it if you’re looking at most. I can also however enjoy a good drama, action movie or comedy. \r\n\r\nSo, now into the bulk of it. I will mainly be talking about horror movies panned by audiences and critics which I enjoyed because there is a surprising amount of them that I like. I first had the thought that I had a bad taste in films when I watched the 2006 remake of Black Christmas. The original is a cult classic and is hailed as the first ever slasher movie as it set the groundwork for the slasher film 4 years before Halloween- I found it reasonably enjoyable. Then, I watched the remake which, if I’m being honest, I hadn’t heard good things about. The general consensus was that it was an unnecessary and bad remake. I loved it. It was fun, beautifully shot and directed and I thought all the characters where entertaining and likeable. Pretty much the opposite of what most people thought. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I watched the 2009 remake of The House on Sorority Row. The House on Sorority Row is a pretty boring, low-budget slasher with some alright kills. The remake on the other hand was a much different beast. It was constantly entertained by it. I thought the direction and the cinematography was great. And the kills. Man, for a horror film with little gore, the kills were so creative. It was a blast. But, as you guessed, the critics hated it and so did audiences. So much so, that it performed very badly when it came out and has been largely forgotten. \r\n\r\nNext, is Urban Legend. Released in 1998, Urban Legend is mainly dismissed as a bad Scream knock-off that was just riding the coattails of the late 90s self-aware slasher boom. However, I think that comparing it to Scream is unfair. It was released in the late 90s so people immediately think that it is just trying to emulate Scream which it really isn’t. The film isn’t trying to make fun of horror movies. It’s got a really interesting premise about murders based on urban legends and this allows the film to get really creative with their kills. I mean the opening scene of this film is enough to keep you hooked. It’s a hell of a ride and, without giving anything away, the killer’s reveal and the subsequent performance by the actor is incredible. Honestly, it’s worth watching the film for the reveal alone. But, once again, hated by most. \r\n\r\nMore recently, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. The first film, IKWYDLS, isn’t too highly regarded by critics but fans of the genre can agree that it’s a classic. The sequel however is hated by horror fans and critics. It has the abysmal score of 8% on Rotten Tomatoes. And I really don’t think it deserves that. Sure, it’s not the best film ever and is definitely not as good as the first - but it’s still enjoyable minus Jack Black’s character which is only really there to add another body to the kill count. It’s a lot gorier than the first but it’s still got the intensity and well crafted scares of the original. And, the saving grace is that Jennifer Love Hewitt finally has a personality! In the first, she’s a pretty bland final girl who’s only there to be the attractive lead. In the \r\nsequel, you can tell she’s come into her own and you like her more for it. \r\n\r\nFinally, the point where I was really questioning my taste, was 2 days ago when I watched the 2006 remake of When A Stranger Calls. The remake basically serves as a stretched out version of the 1979 film’s opening, which is arguably the best part of the original. It’s quite slow but even as someone who doesn’t get too scared, I always had a certain feeling of uneasiness as the protagonist is tormented by the caller. The kills are the only thing that let me down as they are off-screen and you can barely tell that the characters were dead - it was a PG-13 though so that explains it. In the end though, it was creepy and kept me pretty hooked. I just wish it was gorier. But, after seeing the abysmal scores on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, I found myself thinking about my taste.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think? Do you think I have bad taste or that I can just enjoy a bad movie? This no means is saying that I hate good movies - Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Thing and Hereditary are some of my favourite horror films of all time. But does my love of these films somehow make me a worse judge of quality when it comes to film?','Last Christmas',0,33,'2018-11-21 05:19:34'),('9z4o75','The Hidden Message of ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES','','The Addams Family',1,2,'2018-11-21 11:25:38'),('9z7t3n','Jason Derulo Is Rum Tug Tugger In Cats\"\"\"\"','','Cats',2,5,'2018-11-21 16:57:44'),('9zamsa','Who are credits and post-credit scenes for?','I understand allot people work hard on these films and post credit scenes may be a way to get viewers pay more attention to the credits. Its important for industry professionals and their loved ones to have a visible record of who was involved, but i can\'t see the point of sitting through credits for regular watchers. It seems like something solely useful for those involved with making or producing movies. \r\n\r\nFor me it is just a wall of text, and a long list of names I couldn\'t possibly remember.  The only ones I will remember are the actors, and maybe the director. I\'m not sure how much can be done about that. \r\n\r\nIf credits are only useful to a small segment of the population, is it still necessary or wise to have general viewers sit through them to see scenes relevant to the movie they paid to watch? Is there a point to post-credits scenes if moviegoers talk or blank out while they wait for the clip(s)? Relevant scenes could be put before the credits to save time and for convenience.

As far as I’m aware they haven’t confirmed who the villain is going to be in The Batman (could be wrong though).\r\n\r\nThat said there’s definitely an argument to showcase some more of Batman’s vast rogues gallery and I’d like to see some new villains on the big screen, but if Phoenix’s version goes down well they’ll obviously want to capitalise on it, and personally I’d love to see a Batman movie directed by Matt Reeves and starring Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker.\r\n\r\nJust a thought, what do you guys think?','Joker',0,23,'2018-11-23 13:34:34'),('9ztrtu','Had only seen Rocky before seeing Creed (1) when it came out, so am going back to watch the sequels.

Creating a council of experts on the culture/region to help keep the film respectful; the entire cast being of Pacific Island heritage. \r\n\r\nIt\'s always bugged me that these supposedly African characters have American accents in the animated film. Granted, Disney wasn\'t concerned with political correctness in the 90s and I was excited to see if they would treat the remake the same way they did Moana.\r\n\r\nThe original is one of the studio\'s biggest successes, and so I completely understand the business decision to have some Hollywood names on board.

Compared to their sequels both films aim for critical acclaim and awards.  Both didn’t have a sweet storybook ending that left fans hungry for more.\r\n\r\nWRATH OF KHAN VS ROCKY II - These two movies are less for the critics and more for the fans.  Both feature an advisory that’s is stronger and bent of hurting the heroes.  Now that characters are established (for Star Trek it establishing itself to a new generation of moviegoers) both movies focus on the relationship between the main characters.  Kirk, Spock, Bones VS Rocky, Adrian, Mickey.\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR SPOCK VS ROCKY III - Both films feature a new villain that even more ruthless than the previous.  Trek’s 3rd deals with the aftermath of Spock’s death while Rocky’s III also deals with a death of an important character.  Although, with Star Trek spock comes back to life whereas Mickey will not be back. Both deal with resurrection and hope with Rocky finding himself a new trainer become champ again.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE HOME VS ROCKY IV - It’s grab your popcorn time as both film franchises hit their stride in putting out epic and crowd pleasing films.  Both also manage to layer in a political cause in their plot; America’s battle with communism in Rocky and saving the whales in Star Trek.  Both reached movie franchise reached its pinnacle on this movie.\r\n\r\nFINAL FRONTIER VS ROCKY V - Both films are considered the worst films of their respective series and big let downs from their widely popular 4th installments.  Both explore themes of nobility, loyalty and family.  Star Trek pits brother against brother while the Balboa family struggle with finances and a strained father son relationship.  \r\n\r\nUNDISCOVERED COUNTRY VS ROCKY BALBOA - The last films of their respective original franchises.  Both feature protagonists debating their place in world in their autumn of their lives while given a circumstance that will require their best.  \r\n\r\nBut wait there’s more.\r\n\r\nGENERATIONS VS CREED - Studios breath new life into these film franchises by showing the next generation of the previous characters.  Trek features a new captain of the enterprise while Creed features the son of Rocky’s former foe turned friend Apollo.','The Aftermath',0,4,'2018-11-24 17:36:16'),('a04ij9','Does anyone know the name of this movie?','It’s about a little girl about 7, who lives in a suburban house by herself and pretends the animals and stuffed animal she has can talk.

At the end of the movie it’s revealed that she is the monster she fears, like it posses her or something. Any one know what it’s called? There’s a scene in the movie where her parents are trying to get her to remember what she did to them and her brother, and her mother yells out her name.

He portrays every one of the main personalities with such subtleties, it’s phenomenal. The scenes where he goes to visit the therapist after Barry keeps sending those frantic emails in the middle of the night are really what do it for me. In those scenes, it’s not actually Barry who’s coming to see the therapist, it’s usually Dennis or even Patricia. But the audience can tell that, even though this person looks and sounds like Barry, it’s actually one of the others, because of some small distinct way that Dennis moves his head, or Patricia purses her lips at the end of her sentences. It’s kind of hard to explain, but it’s brilliant. I’ve heard some people write off his performance by saying that “oh, it’s easy to tell which alter it is because of the clothes they’re wearing”, but in the scenes where Dennis/Patricia is pretending to be Barry, or whoever, that’s not the case at all.\r\n\r\nLong rambling short, I think he was absolutely brilliant and I 100% think he should have been nominated for an Oscar.

Its main strength is in Pegg and Serkis being self serving bastards, but the movie takes a few detours that sap away the energy. There is an entre subplot about how an actress manipulates Pegg into financing her play, but that really does not amount to much. I guess it does serve as Peggs motivation for going through with the corpse selling and she was there IRL,but it just wasn’t as entertaining as the other parts of the film. 7/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Secondhand lions** \\- Haley Joel Osment spends a Summer with his 2 uncles Robert Duvall and Michael Caine. A very light, fun tone, with some adventure sprinkled here and there via the stories Caine tells Osment, even if not all that much happens over all. Acting wise Duvall and Caine are, of course, great and Osment, given his age, really does hold his own against them. He isn\'t just a cute little kid character, but a lot more feeling and sensitive. 7/10 \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Christopher Robin 2018** \\- The plot is the same generic “guy has to make a presentation to save the company” you’ve seen in all family friendly movies from the 2000s, but my God are the animals cute. I was never a big Winnie the Pooh fan (I didn\'t hate it, I just didn’t see a lot of him on TV), but this bear won me over by the power of his charm alone. The design of him and he rest of the animals as old toys come to life is really solid. Ewan McGregors reaction when he first sees Pooh is amazing. I had a dumb grin on my face during every scene with them. 7/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**The Addams family** \\- The gimmick is they like grim stuff and act like its normal...did..did you get it.\r\n\r\nOK, this I watched when I was little (well, the cartoon at least), so I figured why not shoot up on some nostalgia. The gimmick is amusing and Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd make the movie, but it\'s nothing more than small vignettes strung together with the thinnest of plots. The Mamushka dance is fun and there is also a nice development 20 minutes before the end, but it’s not that well realised. 5/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**The Addams family values** \\- Now with plot (well...slightly more). This is Christopher Lloyds movie, no doubt. The jokes are better, the villain is better, the kids have stuff to do. Better than the first on all fronts. 6/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**War horse** \\- The life of a horse and his temporary owners before and during WW1. Not much not to like; acting’s great, all the stories have their own feel for the tragedy of war. My problem is I didn’t like the main kid, actors fine, it’s just the character seemed very onenote. 9/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Fantastic beasts 2** \\- The characters were all solid and the way they used magic in their everyday life was fun, but nothing happens. Well, there are about 14 things happening, but they are either boring or contradict the previous movie, itself, or the Potter chronology as a whole (no way mcgonagall was a teacher at the time). The focus is so over the place that 2 secondary characters, that have had about 9 minutes of screen time (from this 2 hour and 20 minute film), just stop the movies and have a 10 minute lecture about their dynastic history. The girl literally brings out her family tree. Also Depp is in about 20 minutes of a movie with his characters name in the title. 5/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**BlacKkKlansman** \\- Based on the story of a black guy that joined the KKK. The subject is heavy, but the movie manages to balance it with solid humour. John David Washington is fantastic and has a great chemistry with Topher Grace during their phone calls. Although when I heard that Topher Grace had to re-edit the Hobbit trilogy just to decompress from his role I expected more out of him. Adam Driver was good, the redneck stereotypes were funny, but I don\'t get the point of Alec Baldwin cameo, it didn’t work for me. 8/10\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Blindspotting** \\- Two friends hustling through Oakland.

If that doesn’t happen, is it possible it will get released in a straight-to-Blu-ray fashion or something like that?\r\n\r\nI haven’t been this excited for a movie in a long, long time.

At one point his daughter ran out of her hotel room during the time where the killer is searching for a victim. He looks for his daughter everywhere and finds her on the roof. Either his daughter or himself had the red laser dot pointed on them. The show ended with the killer dressing up as a clown in the circus. The clown has a gun that\'s supposed to shoot jam, but the killer replaced it with a real gun so no one knew. He asked one of the kids in the circus to be a volunteer to shoot someone. I think somehow the killer got the kid to shoot the detective? He survived and fought the killer.

I used to vaguely wonder why she looked different in the subsequent years after Aurora\'s birth, and now I finally see it. Masterful drawing and creativity right here. They even make it appear that she is less green-skinned and more blue-grey, in addition to the slightly changed features. Maleficent was quite pretty when we are first introduced to her, but here she looks worn - tired out. Her eyes look a bit sagged and she is a little slumped over. I wonder if it is because it took so long to find Aurora and the hate was aging her? Maybe because she had nothing else to go on/live for?\r\n\r\nI don\'t remember \'Sleeping Beauty\' ever addressing what Maleficent was up to in that 16 year interval that Aurora was growing up in, so one could assume she kind of retired and went away, waiting and pining away for the day she would be able to get her revenge.\r\n\r\nThis now makes me wonder even more about her back story. Yes, she promised to kill a child/young adult because she wasn\'t invited to the birth celebration, but I would be remiss if I didn\'t ponder what Maleficent\'s reaction would\'ve been had she been invited? And what had she done to be ignored and not receive an invitation in the first place? She\'s a mistress of evil but the movie never gave details on her crimes other than being DISLIKED enough to not be invited to a party and being snuffed out by the Fairies.\r\n\r\nThis is why I dislike Angelina Jolie\'s \'Maleficent\' and feel cheated; that film did not address - in any way, shape, or form - any of the questions I have just posed and have been lingering on for years. Sure Angelina\'s film had parts that should serve as answers for me but that film was a COMPLETE reimagining the of 1959 film and therefore I do not consider it canon.','Maleficent: Mistress of Evil',9,7,'2018-12-02 20:26:43'),('a2pmdh','\'Black Widow\' Screenwriter Jac Schaeffer Has A Screenplay Credit On \'Captain Marvel\'','','Captain Marvel',283,100,'2018-12-03 10:25:35'),('a2ptu5','What are some characters in movies that despite their personality.

But he and where the story goes still managed to take me off guard and I can\'t stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\n For a while this is his most lively and colorful film, it still has his trademark off-center weirdness, but high energy. The performances are still unique, but more humane. The dialogue is fast, occasionally hilarious, and what he does with the period, sort of pointing out how ridiculous it all is, is great. Like the extremely elaborate, and increasingly ridiculous dance number for the queen. Or Nicolas Hoult\'s character literally popping up at random in any scene, with no one really ever bringing attention to this fact. No matter where a character is, outside, inside, in their bedrooms, in the basements, the dark hallways, etc. He just always stumbles into a scene and lays waste to everyone around him. Sort of hoping he get\'s a supporting actor nod, but it\'s probably a long shot. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen about half-way through the film slowly takes a turn. The humor is drained from the atmosphere, there\'s a cold grasp and quiet sadness that starts creeping up. Things become a bit creepy, character dynamics start changing, Emma Stone starts becoming almost diabolical, a strange empathy is felt for Weisz, her downfall is as delicious as Stone\'s social climbing is exciting, and then kind of frightening. The ominous soundtrack plays for long periods of time, just adding a sense of impending doom. Above all is Olivia Coleman. Like, holy damn, her performance is absolutely incredible. She\'s not afraid to strip herself entirely of vanity and make her rather abrasive and unpleasant, but then you figure out why she is this way, and it becomes sad and pathetic. Her screaming at the band and the whole build up to her fainting when she actually has to face her people, she is laugh out loud funny at times, but also a trainwreck. Seriously, what a miserable existence. \r\n\r\nFinally, here come the final moments. What\'s left for the characters? Nothing really. Stone gets her way, but lost her soul in the process. All Coleman has left is her title as a queen even if she doesn\'t have much control or power, and nearly every one dislikes her. No respect for her at all. Even Stone. Who squashes a bunny (please tell me that was partially cgi), which confirmed my hatred of her at that point. Which is funny since I quite liked and was rooting for her at times initially. It seems in a flash the truth smashes into Coleman, she feels the betrayal, so she takes advantage of Stone. In that AMAZING final shot, all life drains from Stone\'s face, she\'s back to being a scabrous whore, and I think she knows it. The queen gives in to her misery, and you realize Weisz was kind of right the whole time. But it\'s a bitter ending for her as well. Then you realize what a huge, cruel, joke, all these people\'s lives are in the first place. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I\'d love to hear how this film made anyone else feel, during and after. I thought it accentuates all of Lanthimos\' best qualities as a director, but never loses his voice. It\'s rich, layered, hugely entertaining, and then knocks the wind out of you. I\'d say it\'s an instant classic in the period piece sub-genre, and for sure one of my favorites. Definitely my favorite film by the director as well. I guess you\'d could say it\'s more accessible, but even then it\'s still going to be pretty challenging and uncomfortable for those not familiar with him.  But once this film clicks you just don\'t want it to end. I loved it!

Deadpool 2, MI Fallout, Solo, Widows, IT, Fantastic Beasts, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kingsman 2, everything is just meh. \r\n\r\nI used to be entranced by the story and find myself consumed by the images, but now I feel like I\'m hovering outside the image, and I see all the shots, the takes, the edits, the acting, nothing feels authentic. \r\n\r\nPart of me thinks that it has something to do with all the CGI and the fact that nothing is impossible anymore. Part of me thinks that stories have changed, and we are trying to tell these giant stories were almost everyone survives and the world is saved. And again another part of me thinks that with everything that\'s going on in the world, I\'m done being surprised, since we\'ve crossed over into crazy-land in real life. \r\n\r\nI am also amazed at how poorly Robocop, Total Recall, Addams Family, Beetlejuice, Pirates of the Caribbeans, Jason Bourne are aging.

My main reason for this is that Toy Story 3 was such a great ending that to continue the story after that would feel strange. However, Toy Story 4 could be a prequel that follows Andy\'s Dad and how he came across Woody. Toy Story 4 was quoted to be a very emotional film and Tom Hanks teared up recording the lines. So I don\'t want to entirely recap the story described in this video so I really recommend watching it but Andy\'s Dad supposedly died right before Toy Story 1(Andy has a sister who is an infant so it can\'t be more than 2 years since he died). Andy\'s dad was also named Andy and he was born in the 1950s and cursed with the horrible disease of polio. He was poor and could not afford many toys but his favorite show(Sheriff Woody) was holding a contest to win a Woody doll. However, he could not collect the required amount of boxtops to win the doll but he sent in a sweet letter asking for the doll with pictures drawn over it. The same year, 1957, Sputnik was launched and toy companies figured that kids were tired of cowboys and would only want spacemen toys. There was only one prototype so they decided to send it to Andy Sr. Fast forward to right before Toy Story 1, Andy\'s dad dies of Post-Polio syndrome but right before he gives Andy a key to a chest with all his toys. They have been in hibernation and since Andy Jr looking strikingly like his dad and has the same name, they think it is the same Andy. In the teaser, you see a homemade toy, which I think could be a toy Andy Sr. makes due to the lack of money to buy his own toys. The only piece of evidence that disputes this theory are the toys that were not at the beginning of Toy Story 1 are in the teaser. This could be a red herring, or maybe a confirmation that my theory is not true.

Most drama clubs have a fall drama and spring musical. With the former  having the performances in December before Christmas break. In this movie they do a fall musical that performs after winter break. I would understand if the characters in the musical (Cabaret) somewhat mirrored the story of the characters in the story so it added to the plot, but it wasn\'t important to the plot. It just introduced us to characters that were important, it could have been chess club and the story would have been the same.\r\n\r\nEdit: 3) he knows where he is going to college in like October of his Senior year which is not how college admissions work\r\n\r\n\r\nMovies like High School musical for example the chronology does make sense because the end of Basketball season does come after winter break and usually aligns with the casting of the Spring Musical.

Perhaps most impressively was how it seemed every detail introduced in the script had a pay-off. Powell\'s story about shooting the kid? Paid off by him saving John at the end. Take your shoes off and make fists with your toes? Oops, now you have glass in your feet because you don\'t have shoes. Marriage problems causing your wife to go by her maiden name? Conceals her identity from an excellent thief, buying John more time. Every single detail was important and had a purpose.\r\n\r\nOn top of the script, the practical action was refreshing and well executed. John Mcclane is one of the most awesome, relatably human action heroes ever. The fire hose jump was riveting. Alan Rickman is a legend. Everything was just pitch perfect.

Not in theatres but a couple of months ago when it was released on DVD. And my opinion of the movie was that it was an average movie with an amazing soundtrack. Yes, some scenes were poignant and made me feel all the feels (I cried pretty hard in one scene), but overall, I didn’t really feel like anything of substance happened. There was no real character development, no character motivation, no real plot. Just a series of events that happened until the movie was over.\r\n\r\nSo how come I can’t get the movie out of my head? Simple. The songs. Not only are the songs such catchy earworms, but they have such high production values, amazing choreography (see: The Other Side), emotional and powerful vocal performances, wonderful instrumentals, and such relatable, strong lyrics. Back when the song first came out, I knew “This is Me” was a winner. I knew it would string a chord with so many people since the lyrics were just so powerful. Even though I hadn’t seen the movie at that time, just listening to the song on its own for the first time had me hoping that it would win the Oscar for Best Song.\r\n\r\nNow that I’ve seen the movie, I’ve come to know the other songs as well. My favourite overall is The Greatest Show, but I also love This is Me, and The Other Side (to be honest, the only songs I don’t really like are Tightrope and Never Enough).\r\n\r\nI feel like I’m rambling randomly a bit here. It’s hard to describe how relatable I find some of the lyrics. I’ll just copy some of my favourite lines from the songs here to try to help get my point across:\r\n\r\n“I am brave, I am bruised, I am who I\'m meant to be, this is me”\r\n\r\n“I\'m not scared to be seen, I make no apologies, this is me”\r\n\r\n“Run away, they say, no one’ll love you as you are”\r\n\r\n“And I know that I deserve your love. There’s nothing I’m not worthy of”\r\n\r\n“Where the runaways are running the night”\r\n\r\n“Take the world and redefine it. Leave behind your narrow mind”\r\n\r\n“I think of what the world could be. A vision of the one I see. A million dreams is all it\'s gonna take”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t in a cage so I don’t need to take the key”\r\n\r\n“You would finally live a little, finally laugh a little. Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it\'ll wake you up and cure your aching. Take your walls and start \'em breaking. Now that\'s a deal that seems worth taking”\r\n\r\n“Won’t let them break me down to dust, I know that there’s a place for us”\r\n\r\n“When everyone tells us what we can be, how can we rewrite the stars?”\r\n\r\n“What’s waited till tomorrow starts tonight”\r\n\r\n“But those are someone else\'s dreams. The pitfalls of the man I became. For years and years, \r\nI chased their cheers. The crazy speed of always needing more. But when I stop and see you here, I remember who all this was for”\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie has some wonderfully inspirational and powerful lyrics. This is Me in particular most definitely deserves to be an anthem to anyone who has never felt accepted or loved for who they are. Because in the words of Lettie: “There’s nothing I’m not worthy of”.','The Tomorrow Man',0,10,'2018-12-15 22:05:09'),('a6pkia','Movies featuring snowmobile action scenes have an average critical score of 51% and average an inflated $369 million worldwide on $111 million budgets. This makes movies featuring jet ski action scenes and their 27% RT score and $123 million worldwide box office average look silly.','When I released my jet ski action scene data years back I received many messages asking me to compile the data for movies featuring snowmobile (or sled) action scenes. I didn’t know if I wanted to do it because it felt too similar to the jet ski data and I didnt’ want to rehash material. However, I felt bad that I was turning down so many requests and I’m always down to point out that jet ski action scenes are terrible, so I went ahead and researched the scenes (there are many snowmobile sites that complain about the usage of snowmobiles in movies) and crunched the numbers on the action scenes!\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI knew the numbers would be better than jet ski movies, however, I was surprised that there weren’t that many of them. I did a A LOT of research and thought I’d have a list around 50 to 60 movies. I ended up with 22 movies that had reliable box office data and critical scores. I had to leave movies like *Tripwire, Santa\'s Slay* or *Icebreaker* (watch it…Bruce Campbell is the villain) out because they didn’t have critical scores or weren’t released theatrically.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes a snowmobile action scene? They are scenes that feature an action set piece involving chases, jumps, spills and beheadings while on snowmobiles. It can’t just be a person riding a snowmobile on his way to an action scene. It has to feature spills, chills, bullets, carnage, avalanches or massive jumps. Watch this [***Die Hard 2***](https://youtu.be/3_zKy7ygsHY) clip and you will know what I’m talking about.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSidenote: I scoured the internet for every snowmobile action scene I could find. If I missed anything please let me know and send a clip.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**Here are the numbers for movies featuring snowmobile action scenes**\r\n\r\n* **Total Number of Movies** – 22 – *Die Hard 2, Snow Day, True Lies, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, xXx, The World is Not Enough, Babylon A.D.,* ***Inception***, *The Fate of the Furious, Jackie Chan’s First Strike, Die Another Day, Agent Cody Banks, Johnny English Reborn, The Santa Clause 2, Fred Claus, Mr. Magoo, Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings* (no box office), *Braven* (no box office), *Lederhosen Zombies* (no box office), *22 July* (no box office), *Deadfall* (no box office)\r\n* **Tomatometer Average** – 50%\r\n* **Domestic Box Office (inflated)** – $156 million\r\n* **Worldwide Box Office (inflated)** – $350 million\r\n* **Budget (inflated)** – $107 million\r\n\r\n\\* I had to make some changes because of the late additions of *Mr. Magoo, 22 July, Deadfall* and *Meet the Deedles*. The real lundgren would be very bummed that I missed these movies. Also, I love *Wind River* but it doesn’t feature any snowmobile action scenes. I figured I would put this here because it will most likely be brought up.\r\n\r\n**Here are the numbers for jet ski action scene movies (for comparison):**\r\n\r\n* **Total Number of Movies** – 17 – *The Pacifier, Hard Rain, Waterworld, Double Dragon, Transporter 2, Transporter: Refueled, Speed 2, Shark Night, Deep Rising, Fool’s Gold, Piranha 3D, Baywatch, Police Academy 3: Back in Training, You Don\'t Mess With the Zohan, Meet the Deedles, Universal Soldier: The Return, Dhoom 3, Manhunt (no box office)*\r\n* **Tomatometer Average** – 30%\r\n* **Domestic Box Office (inflated)** – $61 million\r\n* **Worldwide Box Office (inflated)** – $122 million\r\n* **Budget (inflated)** – $73 million\r\n\r\nWhy are the numbers higher than jet ski action movies? Here is a list that features zero correlation or causation.\r\n\r\n1. Snowmobile action scenes have realistic and life threatening stakes. If you wipe out on a snowmobile you are in trouble. Thus, they are much more exciting and won’t make you fall asleep like you do when a jet ski action scene comes on (I literally passed out during the jet ski chase in *Baywatch*)\r\n2. Vin Diesel loves snowmobile action scenes more than he loves jet ski action scenes. *The Fate of the Furious, xXx, and Babylon A.D*. **>** *The Pacifier*\r\n3. *The Fate of the Furious, Inception, Die Hard 2, The Living Daylights, A View to a Kill, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day* and *The Living Daylights* all made over $300 million at the worldwide box office.\r\n4. Jet ski action scenes basically feature people going in straight lines……\r\n5. 35% (7) of the snowmobile action scene movies have fresh (60%+) Tomatometer scores.\r\n6. 7% (1) of the jet ski action scene movies have a fresh Tomatometer score\r\n7. Directors like James Cameron (*True Lies*), Christopher Nolan (*Inception*), Renny Harlin (*Die Hard 2*) and F. Gary Gray (*The Fate of the Furious*) trust snowmobiles enough to include them in their action scenes.\r\n8. Have you watched the jet ski action scene in *Hard Rain*?\r\n9. James Bond loves snowmobiles.\r\n10. The conclusion to the snowmobile chase in [**Wrong Turn 4 is bonkers**](https://youtu.be/D9m2uoWoFr8).\r\n\r\nMovies featuring snowmobile action scenes **>** Movies featuring jet ski action scenes. The result of this totally unwarranted competition was never in doubt, however, I enjoyed finding out the results so I could write this data piece.\r\n\r\nIf you like this article make sure to check

It is precisely that power which I believe to be the film\'s central theme: the impact watching movies has on our lives. The theatre is the one place where all attendants are synchronized emotionally and their idiosyncratic lives cease to interfere with one another. Where the hero of the story prevails, the audience prevails; where he falters, they stumble too. The story is as much yours as your neighbor sitting next to you as the protagonist on the screen. Human experience is all too real to us that when we see it, life stops so that we can taste it, like the crowd transfixed by the projection on the apartment wall in the film. Men and women fall in love, have kids, grow old, but all those moments there and in between are preserved on that screen, waiting to be lived again. I have never shed so many tears for a movie. These were unique tears of warmth and relief from the realization that the reason we watch movies is the same reason we can love. That we put our passions, pride, anguish, and discovery onto a screen so that we can share the pain and the pleasure side by side. Because we live separate lives with love and loss in our own little worlds but for a few hours a projector and a big screen can unite us into one throbbing well of anticipation, laughter, distress, fervor, catharsis, victory and desire. This movie embodies why we love the movies because they are perhaps the most human thing we as a species can make. If you love movies, please go watch Cinema Paradiso. I would consider it life changing. ','Little Women',21,6,'2018-12-18 01:04:40'),('a7b4ui','Hulu is now streaming 20 James Bond Movies','I freaking love Hulu.

Great sci-fi..(I might rant a bit, fair warning..:D)','Something with some great character development, heroic moments, epic battles.\r\n\r\nThe closest I can think of is Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise, or Independence Day, transformers, battle Los Angeles...\r\n\r\nThing is, they feel like they’re missing something(not so much edge of tomorrow tho, that was an incredible film imo). I’m still waiting on a movie with the common mans perspective, like war of the worlds mixed with the walking dead...starts off like clover field, the earth gets colossally shat on during the invasion, and then humanity begins to gain some footing and fight back. \r\n\r\nPerhaps what I’m looking for is more of an hbo epic, with multiple episodes, Game of Thrones scale.\r\n\r\nBig world...lots of developing characters...\r\n\r\nBasically, the story of Halo, given some amazing dedication by fans of the franchise in the film industry. Or DESTINY! There’s tons of story content out there in the gaming industry that could be fledged out into some HUGE series’ that would rake in TONS and have fans rock solid the entire time.\r\n\r\nThey’d need to start at the root of all of the stories, some quality origin stories...really set the foundations for the shows before delving in, and then, heck, fifteen seasons later I’d probably still be watching, along with all of the other nerdy fans hiding in the crevices of society...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat spurred this question is the movie “American Sniper” on tv right now...I have tried to watch it multiple times but I just can’t get invested. It feels like every war movie is weighed down by politics and morals. Like ya, black hawk down, American sniper, lone survivor, killer yo, some Marines in a foreign country shooting ppl. Are they just defending their homes, are they actual bad guy terrorists?? Who knows really! \r\n\r\nWhat I’m saying here is, I’m just wondering where all of the “the world is being invaded by these monsters, we need to form an underground and fight back, adapt, evolve. \r\n\r\nWe need Destiny. Halo. \r\n\r\nHeck, even a post apocalyptic “Fallout” series would be killer if they put some real fan driven plot lines in. Base it off of the game’s heavily, and then add some Walking dead elements to it...scavenging, establishing little towns...\r\n\r\nInto the Badlands is sort of doing this, but it’s...idk, it feels real “Made in China”.  The dialogue is...rushed? Underdeveloped...\r\nThing is, I still watch it, because the genre is so starved for content. TWD just droned on and on...I stopped watching it. They just kept going until the tank was out of gas...like, Negan, REALLY? Where’s the finality? A cure or a safe haven...why give us this turd with his bat, who talks for half of the episode, for what feels like five season.\r\n\r\nAnyway....lmk if u have any suggestions, books even. I’ve read a lot of the Halo books and they were fantastic. Great storylines, not too difficult of a read. Lounge material, u know?\r\n\r\n..I will say, the film industry is doing a pretty dope job with the marvel universe. It definitely has that “alien invasion” aspect half of the time, although not in the same realm of alien invasion.\r\nYes, they arerushing it quite a bit, would be great if they did some live action shows, or iron man-esque, multiple movies to focus on and develop each character further. Really get a feel for them, see them against their mini villains, without it being a end of the world situation. \r\nEither way, I still think that overall they’re doing something amazing.\r\n\r\nSame with DC. I get that some ppl have been hating on their content, but I think they’ve all been pretty good. Why not develop Aflek Batman some more with a show? See him take down the Joker, riddler, scarecrow, harlequin, killer croc, slade, Ras Alghuul (not sure if that’s how u spell it but whatever), lex Luther..\r\nTHEN tie them in with the justice league. Granted it’s already at that point where they’ve kind of already United them all prematurely...so now anything of that nature would be like an ex rave druggie going to a dance club and trying to enjoy themselves sober, It’s just already been outshined by the epicness of the whole team together.\r\nPpl have been hating on Aflek as Batman but I think he fits the role perfectly, the writers for Batman vs Superman were obviously just drunk af and writing the story in a room with low oxygen...he hasn’t been given much of a chance really. It’s a damn shame. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’ve been typing on my phone for a good halfhour-hour now, and I probably should stop ranting. It’s just...like...dude. GOTHAM? REALLY? YOURE GONNA MAKE A SHOW ABOUT BATMAN BUT PUT OUT THAT TRASH?\r\n\r\nOmg..\r\n\r\nThere’s so much sci-fi potential that could be propelled by the fans, but...it just isn’t happening.\r\n\r\nI guess quick cash grabs are better than dedicated, steady cashflow, from a fan driven community. Maybe YouTube could be the cure..I’ve seen some pretty awesome fan made promo videos for DBZ, and if they started a go fund me account for their films, and somehow like...we as fans were insured to get a good product, I would totally invest.we could even profit off of it once it hits theaters, and since it’s fan driven, you KNOW the final product would be a success...\r\n\r\nGrrrrrrr...\r\n\r\nI guess I’m just an angry nerd tonight..\r\n\r\nTime to go drink beer and eat potato chips.\r\n\r\n','The Tomorrow Man',0,9,'2018-12-19 17:07:51'),('a7rxp8','Judi Dench as Commander Root in Disney\'s ARTEMIS FOWL','','Artemis Fowl',19,13,'2018-12-19 18:34:14'),('a7tqrd','big year for skateboarding films. mid90s, skate kitchen, minding the gap. anything else I should check out?','looking for more to watch! for anyone who hasn\'t checked out the aforementioned.

Malorie and her sister see the news about thousands of people committing suicide in Russia and her only reaction is „it is so far from the USA so why would I care about it“. I think every „normal“ person would be very shocked and curious what is going on there instead of just leaving such comment.\r\n\r\n2.) Why did only one woman who cracked her head against the glass and not every or at least a few people in the hospital see the creature?\r\n\r\n3.) Why did so many cars explode?\r\n\r\n4.) They figured out way too fast they should not look and cover their eyes when they are outside. Ofc they knew something was wrong but I don’t buy they know it is exactly this so damn fast and also that their are actually creatures who drive them crazy there.\r\n\r\n5.) So the mentally ill people do not commit suicide when they see them but they all group together to find and force every sane person to see it? Does it not mean they are still kinda controlled by this creatures so they can catch all the sane people for them?\r\n\r\n6.) Machine Gun Kelly and the policewoman were pointless. They did not contribute in any way to the story and it didn’t matter they left and that the car was not there anymore\r\n\r\n7.) Where were all the cars on the road when they drove to the supermarket?\r\n\r\n8.) Tom was still super muscular and ripped after five years. I know they can not just wait a few months and tell the actor not to train to at least not look that muscular but it still made me roll my eye when I saw it.\r\n\r\n9.) The crazy people drove to their house and once they arrive there they are saying there is nothing and leave. The next time they are coming and just start shooting at their house without evening knowing someone is there (or did they?).\r\n\r\n10.) Malorie and the children ran to the House in the Wood at the end and the dark force followed them and made it look like it wanna catch them but how was it a threat since we all know they can not harm them when they are blindfolded so why did they care so much about it?\r\n\r\n11.) Is the risk not very high the creatures see them when they are outside in the school so they shouldn’t risk to even be there without being blindfolded?\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: 12.) So Gary wanted to force the people in the house to see the creatures from the very first time he came to the house. How did he know how it feels to see them and that he won‘t be suicidal as well? How did he know how they look like or did he only paint them how he imagine them to look like? He only saw them for the first time when he was in the room where the chubby woman just gave birth to her daughter since his eyes only changed then.','Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark',38,92,'2018-12-22 19:43:50'),('a8r3vc','The movie \'Before I Fall\' is seriously grim from the other characters\' perspectives...','So, \'Before I Fall\' was on Amazon Prime so I just checked it out because I\'m home bored with nothing to do. It was pretty much as I expected, pretty typical teen girl cliche stuff but it wasn\'t bad and the lead was pretty good.\r\n\r\nBut then I thought about the ending and it kind of falls apart. We see it from the girl\'s perspective after she\'s lived this same day about 500 times, so the progression and the point she ends up sort of make sense. But what about the other characters? I mean there\'s Juliette, who was saved by the main character... but... she\'s already this social outcast, who is now going to be seen as the reason this popular, friendly girl died. Things don\'t look good for her from here.\r\n\r\nThe boy? Kent, I think? God, I can just imagine the therapy this kid is gonna need. This girl he has been crushing on since the 3rd grade literally breaks up with her boyfriend, tells him she loves him, makes out with him a bit, and then dies. I mean, that\'s not a happy ending. He\'s going to be fucked up over this.\r\n\r\nThe movie was interesting and the message was right, but it really sort of just ignores the aftermath of what actually happened from a perspective other than the main character.

First up let\'s talk **Mary Poppins Returns,** the film that was the most in dire need of a Christmas miracle after it opened to just $23.5M last weekend at a budget of $130M. The film, which is the long awaited sequel to the 1964 Disney classic, just hasn\'t had the same massive global impact Disney was likely expecting, but it did have a pretty good Christmas where it scored $11.4M. Also, it had a $28M second weekend with is a rise of 19% from it\'s previous weekend. It has now grossed almost $100M domestic, so Poppins seems to be out of the domestic flop range but it still has a long way to go for a great run. Meanwhile **Bumblebee** is not fairing as well. While it did scored a $20.5M second weekend it only managed an $8.8M Christmas and ends the Christmas run with just $66M domestic on a $135M budget. One just has to look at [the pitiful state of Bumblebee merch](https://i.imgur.com/vFNyaKN.jpg) to see how poorly this film is fairing with the general public. Despite being better acclaimed than every other Transformers movie it seems that audiences are just too burned on the franchise to care.\r\n* **Christmas Rundown (cont.) -** Speaking of acclaimed films trying to find their audience, **Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse** is one of the most acclaimed films of any medium this year but has not had the same kind of run you\'d expect for such a beloved film. Christmas was rough for Spidey, scoring just $5.6M but it had an okay third weekend where it gained 11.2% for $18.3M, which pushed it over $100M domestic. That at least will give Spiderverse some good bargaining power for its next run on home video where frankly it will have to make most of its money.  Look maybe in your family you watch some pleb Christmas garbage like It\'s a Wonderful Life but in my house we watch Clint Eastwood grumble about pecans and clearly we are not alone. **The Mule** has had a quietly great run this Christmas season where it made $4.9M on Christmas day and had a 24% gain this weekend for a $11.7M haul. The film has already passed its $50M budget domestically and could hold as the adult counter-programming choice in the dead month of January to come.  Small last note, most films gain on this weekend but the one film that dropped was **The Grinch** which dropped 50.3% to come in with $4.2M this weekend. This shows how Christmas movies have a very specific shelf life and after Christmas no one wants to watch Christmas movies. Thankfully The Grinch was smart and released in early November so by the time that drop happened it had already grossed over $250M domestic.\r\n* **Aquaman -** Of course the big winner of the Christmas season is Bird Box memes. No it\'s Aquaman which has taken that sweet Avatar/Star Wars spot and swam with it all the way to the water bank...I\'m so tired. The film won Christmas day with $22M, almost double the second highest grossing film of that day (Mary Poppins Returns with $11.4M). While it was one of the few films that dropped this weekend, it was pretty small with 22% drop to come in with $51.5M. Worldwide though the film is just massive with a whopping 75% of its now $748M gross coming from overseas. While the film has yet to surpass any of the other DCEU films domestically, it has already surpassed the lifetime worldwide gross of Justice League, Suicide Squad, and Man of Steel in just one month of release. At its current rate the film could very well be the first DCEU film to crack $1B worldwide but it will in some part rely on the US. Every DCEU film besides Justice League has made at least $300M domestic and Aquaman could very well do it too, but it needs to keep being the single choice for families and teens for the next month which is quite possible with limited options and being so much ahead of the rest of the Christmas bloodbath.\r\n* **Vice -** And now finally we get to the two new releases which did not exactly ignite the Christmas time box office but did find their own spots. First up is Vice, the biopic of former US Vice President Dick Chenney from now political firebrand director Adam McKay that was something of a final gamble for already in trouble Annapurna pictures. The film carries a shockingly large budget for a modern biopic with $60M and was hoping to become something of the political talking point of the Christmas season. It didn\'t quite do that as it debuted on Christmas with $4.7M and ended its week long run with $17.6M. Not exactly an incredible debut for the rather pricey film. Part of that is likely that many in the US are already sick of politics. Hell just this Christmas had its own political firestorm with the government shutdown. And then there are the reviews which are wildly all over the place with some praising it\'s biting satire and wit and some calling it pretentious and smug garbage. Mostly the whole thing just feels muted and Vice needs a lot more attention put on it for it to stick around in such a crowded marketplace.\r\n* **Holmes & Watson -** Ah yes here it, the film that brought families together by having them all walk out of the theater in mutual horror and disgust. Perhaps it should have been apparent by the very telling sign of not a single review being posted by the time the film was released on Christmas but the reviews for this Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly led comedic take on the Sherlock Holmes characters were just awful. The film currently has a whopping 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, but in a shocking Christmas miracle audiences and critics could actually agree on something, as the film received a terrible D+ rating on Cinemascore and inspired a rash of meme responses about walking out of the theater on social media. It almost became a 2018 Christmas tradition to see this film and then demand your money back. The effects of this insane backlash were felt almost immediately. While the film opened fine on Christmas to $6.4M it dropped immediately by the 26th to $3.4M and then on the 27th to $2.4M. Remember the insane thing about this week is you basically repeat your Christmas day numbers every single day until New  Year\'s. However the response was so vicious that it didn\'t happen for this film. It will be so fascinating to see how bad it drops next weekend. People love Christmas joy but we are also creatures of schadenfreude and I think there\'s a deep part of us that can\'t wait to watch this garbage fire burn.\r\n* **Oscar Movie Round-Up -** It\'s the final qualifying week for Oscar movies so a few of them snuck in under the wire to get their qualifying on. However we are going to start with a film that\'s been out for a bit but has had just wonderful expansions. **If Beale Street Could Talk** added 60 theaters for a total of 65 where it made $759K, a per theater average of $11.6K. The film has just done very well in limited release despite not being quite the same insane critics darling and Oscar contender of the director\'s previous film Moonlight. Expect it to continue this very slow rollout into January. Okay on to the new. **On the Basis of Sex** opened this week in 33 theaters to $690K, a per theater average of $20.9K. Early in the year this seemed to be a lock for a big Best Actress win on subject matter alone. The biopic about Ruth Bader Ginsberg came out the same year as her smash documentary hit RBG and when major portions of the American people have been F5ing on her health updates all year. However, the film itself has not received the best reviews and lead Felicity Jones has had none of the precursor noms for a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars. While this opening shows interest in the subject matter, without a big win for Jones in the next few weeks it could struggle. Now while everyone was trashing John C. Reilly\'s bigger release this Christmas, a more acclaimed film starring him opened this week. **Stan & Ollie** opened in 5 theaters to $79.6K, a per theater average of $15.9K. While the film has gotten good reviews for the portrayals of comedic film icons Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy by Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly respectively, it just has not had the kind of massive Oscar heavy push it needed to squeeze either one into a major acting race, which again could make it struggle in the coming weeks. And one last time with this, another early contender for Best Actress that has just fallen out of favor is **Destroyer** which opened this week in 3 theaters this week to $58.4K, a per theater average of $19.4K. The film starring Nicole Kidman in an transformative role as a grizzled cop has not been the hottest film for critics but was an early festival favorite for best actress. But once again the push has been light and this film just has not gotten the precursors it needs for a major upset at the Oscars.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\r\n\r\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren\'t in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

The former not only began the insanely popular MCU, but also proved that the genre can be hilarious in addition to being action packed. The latter was a dramatic masterpiece of epic proportions and proved that the genre can be emotionally, and politically, resonant. Although there had been many comic book movies before 2008, some that were quite good and even more that were train wrecks, these two movies were trendsetters that influenced the genre massively. I honestly think the comic book movie craze we\'ve been feeling for the past ten years can be drawn back to *Iron Man* and *The Dark Knight*.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, 2019 sees the release of *Detective Pikachu* and *Sonic the Hedgehog*. The former looks like a really good time at the movies and say what you will about the latter, but I think the teaser poster looks like they\'re not messing around with this adaptation. Video game movies of the past have honestly been pretty dreadful. The only good ones are movies that are inspired by video game tropes as opposed to being based on video games, like *Scott Pilgrim vs. The World* and *Wreck-It Ralph*. Hollywood just cannot figure out how to make a good movie based on a video game, but that COULD all change in 2019.\r\n\r\nWill *Detective Pikachu* and *Sonic the Hedgehog* break this losing streak of video game movies? Will 2019 be for video game movies as 2008 was for comic book movies? Will the next decade be over-saturated with video game movies, like the past decade has been with comic book movies? Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\nOR both could be failures and this could be a very dated post in a year...','Sonic the Hedgehog',0,16,'2019-01-01 17:21:34'),('abmyi3','My First Impressions of the Sonic the Hedgehog 2019 Movie Teaser Poster ?','**Note:** I\'m well aware that no trailers or a well lit full-body image of Sonic\'s design for the film have been released yet and the concept-poster featuring Chris Pratt\'s face is not representative of the current project in production. I\'m open to the movie being a quality product and will give it the benefit of the doubt. At the same time however, I disagree that we aren\'t capable of forming or should never form an opinion of any product until after seeing it in its entirety.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I have never been biased against animated characters being translated into live-action. Many films have attempted this to varying reception and it can almost always work in theory. When done well, the illusion can be made plausible within the fiction being conveyed while managing to stay organic in context of actors\' interactions with the characters. Having said that, not all animated characters are equal and do not all fit this mold to equal effectiveness.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIn the instance of what makes up Sonic\'s foundation as a concept, I simply don\'t imagine it working to his advantage. For any live-action media centering on an animated character as the protagonist, especially one built around speed, this is crucial first & foremost for the illusion to hold up, let alone be consistent. It\'s a whole other challenge from examples like **Mary Poppins** or **Roger Rabbit** (even if we take into account that these films used 2D animation as opposed to 3D).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI personally would have preferred an animated movie (CG, if Blur or an equally experienced team worked on it) to apply the level of talent from those cut-scenes under a bigger budget, to re-imagine the worlds we\'ve seen pieces of in the games into a more cohesive setting. The fake Chris Pratt poster alone gave me too many flashbacks to the live-action **Smurfs**, **Yogi**, **Looney Tunes**, and **Chipmunks** movies and theses real posters honestly don\'t leave me optimistic.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nGranted, I\'m not against humans sharing Sonic\'s world either. I actually liked that in the **Adventure** era (despite disliking the idea of Sonic\'s cast living on a more grounded world homaging our Earth) and thought it added a welcome dose of creative variety to civilizations the characters inhabit. A major dislike for me was portrayals of the anthropomorphic characters as visitors from another dimension (cough, **Sonic X**) or general outliers in a world dominated by humans.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIf I directed or helped design a Sonic world to better balance both out, here\'s one example: An alternate Earth or version of Mobius in which humans & anthropomorphic animals coexist (albeit, each within their own societies with their own authorities). You\'d have a government comparable to our own for the largest human civilizations with a military (perhaps loosely adapting G.U.N.), while the animals could primarily live under a Monarchy such as Sally Acorn\'s kingdom.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThese species would be long since used to each other, mostly getting along about the same as everyday people (similar to **Dragonball**), but there would be growing conflicts over balancing technology & nature. Humanity naturally gravitates more toward conveniences & advancements in tech. while many animals feel like their homes/lives are being interfered with too much, which sets up antagonists like Robotnik. The tone of the world would be lighthearted like most of the games but given a little more substance in its world building (somewhat in the vein of the mildly darker **Sonic Sat. AM**).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n2008\'s **Unleashed** was probably the franchise\'s best balance I\'d seen as a whole in human designs cartoonish enough to fit in with Sonic\'s art style as opposed to the overly realistic NPC\'s in **Sonic \'06** or the **Adventure** games\' urban locales. Sonic as a character just doesn\'t fit the tone of our world imo and trying to animate him into it will most likely more often than not work against the illusion by making him + other characters stand out unnecessarily in distracting ways.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**It\'s one thing to debate whether Sonic historically works in 3D to begin with but a whole other ball game to argue whether he fits on this level.

I think unless you have lived in Latin America for an  extended period it may be difficult to become emotionally attached to  the movie like some have commented. So if you aren’t familiar with the  social class structure and indigenous culture and their integration / segregation in Latin America, the movie may not feel so engaging as  otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere was so little plot, just like in life, which may be another turn-off for the regular cinema-goer. But  when things do go awry just like in life, they kind of creep up on you and then Bang! I felt very present in this movie. It can feel surreal in  the moment of crises and watching the three major crises points in the  movie I felt profoundly immersed. The cinematography, sound and the  performances were impeccable. To include children as much they did in this movie and for it to feel utterly convincing is a wondrous achievement in itself.\r\n\r\nI live in Colombia and I felt some of the themes and the general feel of the movie a bit close to home. For instance, the sounds and the images of the women doing the washing on the terraces is remarkably similar to what one might experience in much  of Bogota today despite *Roma* being set in the 1970s! Also *Roma* exuded this melancholic state which is so pervasive in Latin cinema when dealing with historical events and themes of social classes and race. Moreover, it encapsulated the cultural and interpersonal passion and vibe so inherent in Latin America. It got to that almost inexplicable core of what it feels like to live in a Latino family and its broader society.\r\n\r\n*Roma* is  just so unashamedly raw and in some sense too realistic for me. But I  was in awe of the quality of this movie. Roma is unequivocally the best  movie I saw in 2018.','Little Women',4,8,'2019-01-02 10:21:25'),('abvvwi','30 Most Anticipated Movies of 2019','','Dumbo',2,11,'2019-01-02 13:09:45'),('abx2de','\'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\' Film Review: Third Time\'s a Fire-Breathing Charm For Soulful Animated Franchise','','How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World',120,22,'2019-01-02 15:02:22'),('abymar','Isn\'t It Romantic (2019) | Character Posters | Rebel Wilson, Liam Hemsworth, Adam Devine, Priyanka Chopra','','Isn\'t It Romantic',0,8,'2019-01-02 17:33:38'),('ac0akl','Hellboy - What\'s the Difference?','','Hellboy',0,2,'2019-01-02 20:27:57'),('ac0thv','A few questions about four horror movies (A Quiet Place, Truth or Dare 2017, Bird Box, Hush) I watched recently','So, I took a pretty extended break from horror movies since Sinister 2 since I thought it was so awful. Anyways, Bird Box seemed to be the most popular thing in the world so I gave it a watch and really enjoyed. Watched it twice in two days even. After watching Bird Box, I proceeded to watch Hush, Truth or Dare [2017], and A Quiet Place but I have a couple of questions about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Bird Box\r\n\r\n- Why were the kids named Boy and Girl for so long if Tom was around?\r\n\r\n- Why did Malorie not commit suicide when her friend (sister?) did? I thought they were looking in the same direction.\r\n\r\n- What happened to MGK and policewoman?\r\n\r\n- I don\'t understand how those particular birds seem to sense the... evil presence. Why or how are they able to this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Is it explained how the doctor got to the safe zone at the end in the book?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Why did blind people have to go there? Did they make themselves blind upon entry? \r\n\r\n- Was the ending real? This sounds like a silly question but I can\'t help but think that Malorie actually succumbed to the creatures and that the ending was what she wanted her happy ending to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Why can\'t/don\'t the creatures enter buildings?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Hush\r\n\r\n- Does the woman die at the end? I\'m unsure if she survives or just ends up bleeding to death.\r\n\r\n- Not sure if this story is based off of a book (which may have an explanation), but why did the man use a crossbow? Wouldn\'t a gun be better?\r\n\r\n- How did the man end up behind her if she was facing the front (in the bathroom). Was there a window behind her?\r\n\r\n- Why was he there? Is there a reason?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Truth or Dare \r\n\r\n- Why did the guy who initiated the game end up hanging himself? I understand that he was forced to but why was that his dare?\r\n\r\n- This sounds silly but do the women in the end die? I heard a sigh after the crash. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Who was the evil spirit?\r\n\r\n\r\n- When they played Russian Roulette, why did they aim straight for the head, rather than the shoulder or something? It was clear the bullet had to go through them but it said nothing about it having to be a headshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. A Quiet Place (my favorite of the bunch)\r\n\r\n- Why did the man have a microphone in a world where a sound is the last thing you want to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Why did the old man in the forest (he scared tf out of me) scream? Was he crazy?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Why did they decide to have another child? This seems to be the most reckless thing ever.\r\n\r\n- Why are the creatures there and where are they from?','The Woman in the Window',0,12,'2019-01-02 21:25:25'),('ac3eod','The Upside looks terrible','Why is bryan Cranston doing a movie with Kevin Hart?

I feel like I\'m taking crazy pills here.','There were things I loved about this movie. So I\'ll quickfire them off here:\r\n\r\n* The first 5 minutes were amazing. The best opening to a movie I\'ve seen in a long, long time.\r\n\r\n* Bumblebee himself was great. Definitely solidifies him as my favourite character in the series.\r\n\r\n* The soundtrack was pretty good.\r\n\r\n* The action was much improved, I could actually see what was happening in a Transformers movie! And the punches were super crunchy.\r\n\r\n* I liked the villain duo.\r\n\r\n* John Cena wasn\'t half bad!\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, this is a deeply, deeply flawed movie. How does this have a 97% on RT? Here\'s just to name a few:\r\n\r\n* The writing for most part was awful. 90% of the humour did not land at all. The human dialogue specifically was pretty forced and just badly written. I feel like mostly every other line was exposition for why we should feel bad for the main female character.\r\n\r\n* Speaking of the human characters, as is tradition with the Transformers movies most of them sucked. The family were annoying and weird, the nerdy guy just felt shoehorned in for the purpose of being a romantic interest/a relatable geek character for the viewing audience. \r\n\r\n* The female lead just felt like she had no flaws or weaknesses. She was pretty much good at everything. And her whole diving backstory... I just didn\'t care about at all. We need her to accomplish something significant at the end right? So a big she finally dives again scene! Why did she have to dive in the water at the end anyway? It isn\'t like she helped get Bee out of the water or anything.\r\n\r\n* There was a scene in this movie that was pretty much the exact scene from the Iron Giant. Bee remembers, Bee\'s eyes turn red, Bee starts shooting soldiers up, Bee calms down. How did he even get his memory back? He stuck his finger thingy in a freaking power outlet and nothing, but she shocks him with a little zap gun a few times and suddenly his memory reboots for whatever reason... what?\r\n\r\n* The ending was everything I hate in an ending. Cliche cringey character exchange and a awkward after credits scene for closure I guess? (The one when she starts her dads car and they awkwardly have to show us her driving it for whatever reason...),\r\n\r\nSo yeah... I don\'t get it. Maybe if the movie had a better writer attached, but the way it is, it\'s just an average blockbuster with a lot of untapped potential. I liked it, but 97%?  I feel like I saw a different movie from everyone else. Cybertron prequel when?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Isn\'t It Romantic',11,76,'2019-01-03 08:01:15'),('ac5s3t','PLEASE HELP ME TO FIND A MOVIE','Hello.

Her history is lurid and distasteful, but she owns up to it and indeed uses it to her advantage.   She is well-bred but claims her history is one of pluck and hard work. \r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) is Clinton.  She is the successor to the throne, slimy and coercive, but traditionally so.  She is secure in her entitlement, and not concerned by Abigail, who she treats as a non-threat.  \r\n\r\nQueen Anne (Olivia Colman) is America. Initially she is content to let the Duchess make decisions for her, but later grows weary of her entitlement. Worn down by the campaign for her allegiance, she becomes tired and sick, falling easily for the enthusiastic Abigail who is ready with a soothing, reassuring balm for her aching legs. \r\n\r\nRobert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), the Opposition leader, represents the Republican Party, who is desperate to ascend to power to lessen the burden for the overtaxed landowners whom he represents. \r\n\r\nRepresenting the (for lack of a better term) alt-right is  Baron Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn) who is infatuated with Abigail, falling in love with her despite her sordid past. He is blue balled with promises until a wedding night handy provides him with enough of a release to allow him to ignore that he isn’t getting what he thought he signed up for for. Cuckolded, he watches his betrothed dance with others. \r\n\r\nOther details off the top of my head: \r\n\r\nThe Duchess being dragged through the mud after burning her incriminating -emails- letters. Her belief that her (married) name, and insider experience will carry her through. And, ultimately, her Nike swoop-shaped branding (ht: my girlfriend), which coincidentally appears as she  winds up in the shelter of a brothel. (By which she adamantly denies being prostituted.)\r\n\r\nAbigail catching the Duchess fucking the Queen as she’s skulking in The Queen’s private chambers.  She immediately breaks her promises, neglects her Queen and abuses her power. \r\n\r\nThe final scene: the Queen, mistrustful of Abigail after seeing her true colours, is ravaged and rueful, but her vulnerability necessitates that she lean on Abigail, knowing she will be betrayed, but having no other place to turn.  Abigail, meanwhile, realizes that  the ending has begun, but is cautiously confident, gambling that the Queens unsteadiness and insecurity will provide enough latitude for her to escape with her head intact, and still l attached to her body.   Uncertainty lingers as the screen fades to black. \r\n\r\nCue credits that look like the American flag. \r\n\r\nThere are probably a lot more clues and allusions that I’m missing, as I’m not terribly knowledgeable about the details of Trumps reign of terror, and also because I got kind of drunk on Jameson’s in the theatre. \r\n\r\nAlso I don’t know what the fuck the rabbits represent.

I’m not familiar with the comics but based on the basic logic of the ‘suicide squad’ as presented in the film, wouldn’t the Joker have been a much more compelling villain than the Enchantress? The whole point of the suicide squad is to have a team of (supernatural) individuals that lack the moral compass of our traditional heroes right? Then shouldn’t their main purpose have been to do something which traditional heroes specifically refuse to do, like perhaps; assassinate an unredeemable villain that terrorizes Gotham time and time again because a certain caped crusader is too strict on his morals to solve the issue for good (granted; Affleck’s Batman wasn’t as strict on his morals as Bale’s but still). Wouldn’t that have given the film 1; a much more exciting and unpredictable story, 2; actual dilemma’s and moral conflicts, and 3; a more interesting purpose for Batman as he crosses path with the suicide squad on his own quest for justice?','Joker',23,42,'2019-01-04 15:22:52'),('acpg2g','M.

Most importantly though, it manages to reference its predecessor subtly enough that you never feel like you’re being beat over the head with an onslaught of inside jokes. Sometimes, it’s a poetic re-creation of a scene from the original Trainspotting.

From a nobody.','Most of these Best Of lists start out by saying how great of a year it has been for film and how it was hard to narrow down the “best” to just ten. While I do genuinely love these ten films, I can say that this has been one of the slower and least impressive years for films that I’ve lived through. Here’s to the one’s that did impress, though; and hopefully an even better 2019.\r\n\r\nHonorable Mentions: \r\n\r\nAvengers: Infinity War \r\nFirst Reformed\r\nBlindspotting\r\nAnnihilation\r\nCreed II\r\nGreen Book\r\nMid90s \r\nBurning\r\nBlack Panther\r\nA Quiet Place\r\nPaddington 2 \r\n\r\n\r\n-	10. BlackKklansman\r\n\r\nWhile I greatly admire Spike Lee as a filmmaker, I never really know what I’m going to get with his films as a large portion of his resume varies in quality. One thing that hardly ever changes is his approach for detailing politics in his art, and his embracive approach to being unsubtle and completely angry with passion. BlackKklansman is the best of what Spike Lee can do when he’s at the top of his game. It’s stylish, intelligent, unexpectedly funny, beautifully acted, and downright powerful. It’s his most impressive entry yet.\r\n\r\n-	9. The Favourite\r\n\r\nIs it really a top ten list if there isn’t a star-studded period piece on here? The Favourite is one of the most entertaining and amusing films of the year – until it isn’t. Yorgos Lanthimos perfectly balances the absurdist humor with the more darker elements at play. Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz, and Olivia Colman share wonderful and diabolical chemistry with one another; all three worthy of awards attention. Not exactly a crowdpleaser, but I ate its beautiful cinematography, wit, and performances up.\r\n\r\n\r\n-	8. If Beale Street Could Talk\r\n\r\nIn his follow up to Moonlight, Barry Jenkins delivers a warm, heartbreaking, and unapologetically romantic film with If Beale Street Could Talk. I just love Jenkins’ approach to naturalism and capturing his characters so intimately. You get to know these characters so well and feel the love they feel so deeply – so when the despair inevitably hits, it hits ten times as hard. Not ashamed to say that it made me cry quite a bit by the end.\r\n\r\n-	7. Hereditary\r\n\r\nMost horror films that are hyped up to be “deeply disturbing” or are claimed to be one of the “scariest films of all time” don’t live up to the hype. While I can’t say that I jumped in my seat during Hereditary, I can say that the imagery and sheer evil within the frames deeply haunted me to my core and I’m still thinking about it here in December. Toni Collette and Alex Wolff give career-best performances in this, and Ari Aster proves to be one of the most promising voices in horror moving forward.\r\n\r\n-	6. Mission: Impossible – Fallout \r\n\r\nI’ve been a big fan of this franchise for a while now, because I’m constantly impressed by how each director is able to breathe new life into the franchise with each new entry that is made. On top of that, this franchise is also a vehicle for Tom Cruise to constantly top himself with crazy stunts. With Fallout he manages to make not only the absolute best film of the franchise, but one of the finest action films of all time. Every shot and frame of this film is perfected, every action sequence and stunt is exhilarating to the fullest degree, and the story and characters are still somehow not lost in the midst of it all.  In this, I believe Ethan Hunt is solidified as the best spy character of all time. Sorry, James.\r\n\r\n\r\n-	5. Roma\r\n\r\nThe pure craft and mastery that is on hand in this film is truly unfair. Alfonso Cuarón is truly a master of the craft at this point. I was swept away by the intimacy and humanity of this film, and how every corner of every frame of this film felt like it mattered to the vision that Alfonso had for it. It’s heartbreaking, but at its core it’s about love and family – and that’s why it didn’t leave me totally depressed by the end.\r\n\r\n-	4. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\r\n\r\nI’ve been a huge fan of Spider-Man ever since I started reading the comics when I was only six-years old. I’ve at least enjoyed every movie that has come out about the webhead thus far, but Into the Spider-Verse is the best entry since Raimi’s Spider-Man 2 and the best encapsulation of what Spider-Man means and why he resonates with so many people. The message that anyone can wear the mask and be a hero is simply inspiring for anyone who has ever read a Spidey comic or seen one of the films and wished that was them. On top of all that sappy stuff, the animation on display here is simply some of the most stunning and dynamic that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen it three times now, and it only gets better with each viewing. From the visuals to the characters and story – it’s truly something special.\r\n\r\n-	3.  Won’t You Be My Neighbor?\r\n\r\nFred Rogers is the epitome of good. It’s almost hard to believe that a person could be so purely nice and loving just because it’s the right thing to do. This documentary is one of the most pleasant and inspiring films I’ve seen in quite sometime; it’s the type of film that makes you want to leave the theater and become a better person in your everyday life. Won’t You Be My Neighbor? is a brilliant and lovely dive into the cultural importance of not only the show, but the man behind it all. Love is truly all you need.\r\n\r\n-	2.  Eighth Grade\r\n\r\nMuch like The Favourite and period pieces, it wouldn’t be one of my top ten lists if you couldn’t find a coming-of-age film somewhere on it. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade is an intimate and extremely relatable portrait of growing up in the midst of the social media age. A lot of these films tackle themes of insecurities and anxiety, but this is truly one of the first to dive into how much social media’s presence affects the lives of teenagers. Even with that commentary out of the way, it’s just relatable for anyone who ever felt awkward socializing at this age. Elsie Fisher’s performance is so authentic, vulnerable, and lovely that it is nearly impossible not to root for Kayla to overcome all her insecurities and problems. This is just simply one of the most emotionally resonant and realistic films I’ve seen in a while. Total masterpiece.\r\n\r\n-	1. A Star is Born \r\n\r\nA Star is Born has been done so many times that they had to include dialogue in this film acknowledging that this is a remake with the same story you’ve seen before. And yet, Bradley Cooper brings so much passion into this tired story that he delivers the absolute best telling of it yet. From the gorgeous cinematography, immersive concert sequences, a sweeping romance and chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, and a hard hitting, gut-punch of an ending – I can honestly say that this was the most memorable and beautiful experience I’ve had with a film all year. I was thoroughly entertained, charmed and delighted, and then absolutely destroyed by its emotion.

I read on the wiki that the \'human alien\' plot was going to be bigger and more involved, but if you scrapped the details, the whole thing should have been scrapped.\r\n\r\nThe voice acting is good, but Robin Williams, I love you, God Bless but you should not have been culturally appropriating Hispanics and African Americans in 2006. Who thought this was okay? Please tell me. \r\n\r\nWhich leads me to the jokes and the biggest question I have. How is this movie PG? The visuals and what I heard was not what was said on screen!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLovelace: \'Go forth and multiply!\'   \r\nWhat I HEARD: \'Go f\\*\\*\\* and multiply\'  \r\n\r\n\r\nRamon: (in reference to the elephant seals) \'They\'re kelp sulkers\'  \r\nWhat I HEARD: \'They\'re c\\*\\*k suckers\' \r\n\r\nWhat were they thinking? \r\n\r\nOn the plus side, they did an accurate representation of a church in Antarctica. (There are 8 churches on the continent  from different countries, mostly Christian establishments) Which does not help the blatant and obvious signs of racism that are shown to the smaller penguins from the emperor penguins.   \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I went back and watched the trailers, the weirdness of this film was not shown in any of them. It was a wholesome good time and maybe a 70-90 minute movie. None of the human stuff was outright advertised in the film.   \r\n\r\n\r\nSo if you have seen the movie, what do you think of it 10 years later?  Is it the same wholesome entertainment that was projected at kids so long ago?  \r\n\r\n\r\nDid it really deserve that Oscar?

I’m a sucker for theater but to watch theater bleeds into the movie blurring the reality and fiction was brilliant. What I love about this movie is how the theater director Evangeline  was mentally abusing Madeline by using her mental illness and her dysfunctional relationship with her mom for her own gain in order to do the play. It’s a perfect example of not just theater but how movie directors abuse their actors in order to get the peformance out of them for the movies. I think Kubrick abuse of Shelly Duvall for the shining is the most notorious example of this practice. Helena Howard performance though was amazing especially the monologue she did by the end of the movie imitating her own mother. Everybody talking about yalitza aparicio,Elsie Fisher, and Thomasin McKenzie being breakthrough peformances of this year but Howard amazing debut performance blows them all out of the water.

It felt like the turning of a new chapter in cinema, a sign of changing, increasingly more accepting times. Out of all the movies released that year, I would have to say that this film was the one I had the highest hopes for. However, once I saw it, these hopes were brutally dashed.\r\nLike I said, this movie was supposed to signal a turning point in cinema and our culture as a whole. Finally, a mainstream release about a gay person (that ISN’T Brokeback Mountain). For this reason, I expected this movie to tackle something greater, or at least make SOME sort of wider statement.\r\nThere are a lot of ways this movie could have represented the gay experience and the struggles of LGBT folks in America. Some people are beaten, disowned, or shunned from their social circles. Personally, when I came out, a great deal of my male friends stopped hanging out with me because they assumed I wanted to have sex with them. These and many other (worse) issues are prevalent in our society and are a serious issue that need to be addressed, yet Love, Simon, a pivotal movie about the gay experience, explores none of them.\r\nThe tension in this movie comes from Simon’s wish to keep his sexuality a secret. Yet, throughout the entire film, I am never given a compelling reason WHY he wants to keep it a secret. Simon lives in an extremely diverse middle to upper-middle class suburb. We hardly ever see any genuine example of homophobia, save for a few snickers from a handful of kids (and when those two bullies mimicked gay sex on a table. Who bullies like that? Seriously??). This not only squanders the tension in the movie, but completely avoids an opportunity to showcase a genuine example of the HUGE ISSUE OF HOMOPHOBIA. \r\nAnd once it gets out that Simon is gay, except for the idiot bullies mentioned earlier, virtually nobody significant doesn’t support him. Shit, his father f*cking cried and hugged him tightly because he felt so bad that Simon had to keep his secret for as long as he did. Seriously, where is the tension in this movie?? Where is the conflict? \r\nOh, I get it, all the conflict comes from this kid who is blackmailing Simon. But like I said, they’re in probably the most liberal town ever, so I don’t really see why that’s a good source of tension. And when Simon manipulated his friends? Anyone could see that that was going to blow up in his face from a mile away. It’s the most utterly predictable Disney-TV-show plot I’ve ever seen in a movie this universally lauded. \r\nAm I missing the point? It seems like everyone is absolutely crazy about this movie. It feels like I’m missing something, like I’m being left out of some secret, but to me, it’s glaringly obvious that this film pretty much fumbles every chance it gets to make any statement about anything. How did this yogurt-ad of an attempt at social commentary get nearly the same score as 2001: The Space Odyssey on RottenTomatoes? I’m seriously asking. I genuinely don’t understand. If I’m forgetting something, please enlighten me, because I am utterly confused.

It certainly does take a lot more fantasy elements akin to designs from LOTR/Hobbit with some steampunk sprinkled in somewhere, and it has more of that **pop** that makes it stand out.\r\n\r\nAnd, you know, the CGI\'s pretty good.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I have nothing else to say, not because there isn\'t anything else to say but because I\'d much rather have you, the reader/viewer/being experience these two films for yourself, and it\'s probably the best time to do so since that reboot will be released in a few months.','Hellboy',5,14,'2019-01-14 00:36:21'),('afwlh1','Joaquin Phoenix: Depicting the Dark Side | JAMES GRAY | TIFF 2019','','Dark Phoenix',1,0,'2019-01-14 10:01:13'),('afxm4t','Little Woods Official Trailer Starring Tessa Thompson ,Lily James','','Little',51,47,'2019-01-14 11:43:12'),('ag0j7s','Sir Patrick Stewart convinced us all that Charles Xavier should sound English','I can\'t find anything on the internet about this...

The company allows streaming rights for a limited time with the understanding that the streaming service will advertise the sequel in conjunction, therefore increasing the appeal of the IP? You bring in new consumers to the streaming service by advertising new content that’s relevant to the current zeitgeist and they get advertising for their new movie. \r\n\r\nThis would be even more powerful with big blockbusters imagine the draw of being able to advertise the availability of every Fast and Furious movie prior to the release of 9; you’d get more than a few new subscribers I would imagine.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn’t work in every case as some streaming rights are obviously already locked up.

However, while watching John Wick: Chapter Two, there seem to be some indicators that it may not be so secret.\r\n\r\nFor one, John Wick\'s house is blown up, and no one who arrives seems to ask logical questions except the cop that already knows about John\'s life. Then there are several scenes where John is fighting people or bleeding out in public, yet most people seem only mildly curious. On the train when John and the other guy are clearly about to fight, some bystanders seem to be glancing at them but keeping their heads down, like they know what\'s going on. And when John is fighting, they stay pretty silent and wait for the first moment to get out.\r\n\r\nAnd if you think about the Continental Hotel, it seems that just anyone can walk in, and the staff don\'t even check for membership to keep ordinary people from finding out what the hotel is for. I mean, what if an ordinary person walked in thinking it was an ordinary hotel? How would management explain what it is or why people are carrying guns and using different currency?\r\n\r\nThen at the end of the movie, Winston has somehow arranged for everyone in the park to pause at his command, and there are a surprising amount of seemingly ordinary people getting the alerts about John Wick\'s bounty while he and his dog are running away.\r\n\r\nSo my question/theory is whether contract killing is actually something that is largely well known and even fairly accessible in society? The organizations John worked with clearly keep secret, and I doubt it\'s legal, but with how many people seem to know about it and how it\'s reacted to in public, it seems possible.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Has anything like this been confirmed behind the scenes and I haven\'t heard about it? Or am I just grasping at straws?','It: Chapter Two',0,4,'2019-01-21 17:46:47'),('aigxe8','Interview with West Dylan Thordson, composer of the \'Glass\' OST','','Glass',15,5,'2019-01-21 19:17:31'),('aih4lv','First Poster for Netflix\'s Horror-Thriller \'Velvet Buzzsaw\' - Staring Jake Gyllenhaal, John Malkovich, Tony Collette, Daveed Diggs, and Rene Russo - Directed by Dan Gilroy (\'Nightcrawler\')','','Velvet Buzzsaw',1526,119,'2019-01-21 19:39:12'),('aii14z','Glass Isn\'t a Very Good Movie - Folding Ideas','','Glass',0,9,'2019-01-21 21:19:51'),('aiiqn3','I created a playlist (with 24 artists) to be played in sync with the classic Disney film Aladdin','','Aladdin',0,2,'2019-01-21 22:40:30'),('aij8wf','Attack The Block Is Awesome.','\r\n\r\nSo with Joe Cornish’s “The Kid Who Would Be King”about to release and getting some good initial buzz , I though it would be fun to go back and watch his first movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cousin playing in the movie so I remember being really excited for it back in 2011,  but because of a personal awful turn of event I never got to watch it back then and all the years after until today.\r\n\r\nAnd wow what a romp.

I don\'t understand why they\'re given a project when I\'m sure there are plenty of directors who love to original story, and who would be faithful to it. \r\n\r\nFirst example is David Yates with the Harry Potter movies. The guy never read any of the books and it SHOWS big time in the movies. The first 3 Harry potters were good movies and captured the magical feeling that the books had. GoF was all right. But order of the Phoenix and Half Blood prince were just objectively awful, leaving out 75% of the storyline that was in the books. Why not have a director sign on who actually liked the books and would do them justice? That always bugged me so much. \r\n\r\nAnother example is Josh Boone. He signed on to do the New Mutants movie, which could be AMAZING if they\'re anything like the comics. HOWEVER, Josh Boone has been very vocal about disliking the comic book franchise. WHY would you want to direct a movie about a series that you dislike?? Now the New Mutants movie has turned into a gigantic clusterfuck of being postponed, allegedly being so terrible that they needed to re-shoot MULTIPLE scenes. That\'s to be expected though, when a director openly dislikes the source material that they\'re adapting. I can understand putting your own flair into things and making it your own, but to completely butcher something to the point that it has nothing in common with the original story, except for the name, that just seems sheisty and a way to use a successful franchise as a way to make a few quick bucks. \r\n\r\n\r\n','The New Mutants',0,77,'2019-01-22 11:46:32'),('aip5hw','Half in the Bag - Glass','','Glass',453,220,'2019-01-22 12:29:53'),('air189','What company produced those cartoons in the late 80s or early 90s where the kid tells you how to adjust the tracking?','I\'m trying to remember the name of a small production company that mainly (if memory serves) produced foreign children cartoons that were dubbed in English.

(More details in description if you need to know more about the span of Solo\'s effect in the Star Wars universe.)','Ron Howard says there\'s no direct sequel to Solo but since Maul is still active with his Crimson Dawn syndicate and Qi\'ra takes the place of Dryden Vos, there could be a gang war between the 5 active syndicates (Jabba\'s Hutt Clan, Maul\'s Crimson Dawn, Pykes (the guys from the Kessel mine), Black Sun, and the Crymorah). Dryden Vos had Han, Chewie, Qi\'ra, and Beckett steal from the Pykes so it would start some conflicts after Wookiees started breaking out of the slave operations in the Pykes\' mines. I\'m guessing it would be so disruptive the Empire would have to get involved (explains how Pyke-controlled Kessel after Solo fell into Imperial control, watch Star Wars Rebels\'s first episode). This story to my guess could involve Darth Vader seeking out Maul with his fellow Inquisitors (Former Jedi, now Imperial hunters of Force-sensitives not wiped out already by Order 66, antagonists in the Rebels animated series). A Vader vs Maul duel was going to happen in Rebels but removed for story reasons but there\'s no reason why it can\'t happen with Maul escaping after losing control of Crimson Dawn. Not to mention Maul used to lead the Hutt Clan and Black Sun alongside the planet Mandalore during the Clone Wars prior to founding Crimson Dawn in the Imperial era so there will be cold blood between Jabba and Maul. This type of story can involve bounty hunters like Boba Fett, Bossk, Dengar, IG-88, Cad Bane (from Clone Wars). This story would also show how the Sith further rejects and increases their desire to wipe out Maul after Palpatine already disrupted Maul\'s power in the Clone Wars and Vader having a role in removing Maul from the criminal underworld. Basically, the Empire as a DEA-enforcer becomes major drug lord after claiming some of the syndicates\' operations. For Han, Chewie, and Lando, they would make cameos and it would only to finish the Han-Qi\'ra unfinished business at the end of Solo.\r\n\r\nLink on Ron Howard\'s syndicate war details: https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/15-things-learned-solo-star-wars-story-ron-howard/\r\n','The Sun Is Also a Star',5,23,'2019-01-26 00:28:26'),('ajz9hh','Whats your little movie that could?','A film you think the vast majority of people wouldn’t have heard of due to any number of reasons.

He is now a grown man with a wife and family of his own.\r\n\r\nThere is some distance between him and his youngest son (who is the spitting image of Kevin, and has the same attitude) as Kevin spends long hours working as an engineer.\r\n\r\nKevin and his family go to the original McCallister house for the holidays, as Kevin has decided to take the whole family on a trip to bring them closer together in the name of Christmas.\r\n\r\nI haven’t figured out how Kevin’s son ends up getting left Home Alone without making it completely contrived, but that’s what I think should happen.\r\n\r\nWe see on TV that the “Wet-Sticky bandits” are finally being released after 25+ years behind bars.\r\n\r\nMarv is more or less ready to move on with his life, having a bunch of new “business” ideas (all of which are terrible). But Harry is still angry after all of these years losing to that kid, and he makes it his mission to finally make Kevin pay for what he did to them. Of course, he convinces Marv to help him because Harry calls the shots.\r\n\r\nThere would be some chance for comedy with Harry and Marv trying to adjust to the modern world, using Google etc to find Kevin and track him down. They see an article online about his success, riches, and his beautiful home that he designed and built himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Kevin and his family are stuck in a blizzard and all planes are grounded. He can’t get back home to his son.\r\n\r\nEssentially something would happen where the bandits find Kevin’s home and decide to break in and settle the score once and for all.\r\n\r\nKevin gets in contact with his son and tells him to look in a safe in his office. The son finds a blueprint for “Operation Ho Ho Ho 3.0”. It is revealed that Kevin built his house with built in traps and things, knowing that eventually one day Harry & Marv would come looking for him.\r\n\r\nKevin walks his son through what to do, more or less, but is unable to get to him.\r\n\r\nHarry & Marv show up and the usual funhouse comedy ensues. This time, however, Kevin’s son makes a mistake and ends up getting nabbed.\r\n\r\nMuch like in the first movie, where Old Man Marley shows up just in the nick of time, Kevin arrives just in time to save his son with his final trap.\r\n\r\nHappy Ending etc.”\r\n\r\nObviously there a lot of gaps and stuff, but I think it would be cool to see a grown up Kevin finally getting to square off against his enemies, and come full circle having made the same mistake his parents made.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Is there anything you would add/change?

But with that said, I have never been more impressed with a score than I was with 2049. It’s not so much the variety or how great the songs are or anything like that, but it’s just how deeply immersed in the film it makes you. The second time I saw this film, I saw it in an IMAX theater with pretty much no one else there, and it was the best movie watching experience I’ve had in my whole life. The sound was so overwhelming and powerful, that I just completely forgot about everything else going on in the world, and was just completely and utterly focused on the movie. I see a lot of people complain about scores where the music just goes “BWAHHHHHH” for like 3 hours, and I usually am not a huge fan of that either, but since that was much of the original Blade Runner’s soundtrack, I think it works much better in 2049. But the score and just the sound overall, was just so overwhelming and I have never been so engrossed in a film, and even though I was rewatching it in my school’s dining hall with tons of other people around, I was still just as engrossed in the film. The power of the music and sounds just drags you in like no other film I’ve ever experienced.

The fact that it opens with an Oscar Wilde quote should be enough to confuse anyone who’s bracing for another tedious riff on “Taken.” The quote reads: “Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go,” and while that may seem like a pretentious little preamble for a film that features Neeson shooting a bridal shop clerk in the face with a sawed-off sniper rifle, it turns out to be the perfect table-setting for a fiendishly entertaining, pitch-black revenge story about a decent man who develops a violent knack for being the worst the worst part of anyone’s day.\r\n\r\n[Scott Mendelson - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/01/28/review-liam-neeson-cold-pursuit-is-the-years-first-great-comedy/#4be20e58e5b8)\r\n\r\n>This is an unexpectedly hilarious movie. The original film was something of a comedy-in-disguise as well. This version, perhaps if only due to the localized nature of many of the jokes (there’s a reference to the sad Cleveland Browns that slew me) had me laughing even harder. It’s not that the film is full of pratfalls or sight gags so much Baldwin’s dialogue is so specific and so lived-in that it becomes a ghoulish pleasure to watch these people talk to each other.\r\n\r\n[Chris Nashawaty - Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/01/28/cold-pursuit-review/)\r\n\r\n>If [Cold Pursuit] sounds like murder-by-numbers Liam Neeson Mad Libs, well, it kind of is. But what sets Cold Pursuit apart from its predecessors is its tone. It has the jokey, self-amused vibe of an Elmore Leonard novel or one of those arch, wannabe Tarantino knock-offs that sprouted up like toadstools in the wake of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and were quickly forgotten. It knows exactly what kind of movie it is, but that doesn’t stand in the way of it goosing its bloodbath set pieces with irreverent, off-kilter gallows humor.\r\n\r\n[Alonso Duralde - The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/cold-pursuit-film-review-liam-neeson/)\r\n\r\n>Both the action and the comic elements in “Cold Pursuit” work reasonably well. Neeson can do justifiable homicide in his sleep by this point, but it’s still fun to watch him dispatch goons and scumbags. And most of the film’s gags land, particularly Viking’s helicopter-parent preoccupation with his son’s diet and the pokes at proper language when referring to indigenous peoples. It’s the combo of dark humor and violence where the movie never quite reaches a balance. To be too jokey removes the stakes of the killings, and to be too grotesquely violent makes the laughs catch in the throat. This isn’t an impossible mix, as the Coens and other filmmakers have proven over the years, but Moland and Baldwin fall a bit short.\r\n\r\n[Witney Seibold - IGN](https://m.ign.com/articles/2019/01/28/cold-pursuit-review)\r\n\r\n>That\'s not to say that Cold Pursuit doesn\'t also possess a wicked sense of humor. The over-the-top characters, and Coxman\'s shocking ease of blood vengeance, are both sources of dark, sardonic laughter. There is a great deal of quirk at play in Cold Pursuit, a quality perhaps more openly enjoyed by \'90s indie junkies like myself. Action aficionados may be frustrated by Cold Pursuit, especially after the action-packed first act; Those first few kills are undeniably awesome. But this is not a Taken-like shoot-\'em-up. It\'s a weary contemplation of old men and their waning roles in criminal spheres. With Cold Pursuit, Moland, and perhaps Neeson as well, appear to be closing the book on a certain type of revenge thriller that has been Neeson\'s stock in trade for the last 11 years. We\'ve had a lot of fun, but Cold Pursuit argues that it\'s okay to mourn the passing of a genre now.\r\n\r\n[Courtney Howard - Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/cold-pursuit-review-1203120783/)\r\n\r\n>“Cold Pursuit” isn’t concerned with being the type of non-stop action vehicle where Neeson utilizes elaborate fight choreography and does complicated stunt work. This film’s brutality is grounded in reality. Sure, the unrelenting tension mounts into a climactic shootout, but the rest of the picture is more akin to the razor-sharp precision and gallows humor of “Fargo” than the merciless vigilantism of “Taken.”\r\n\r\n[Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-cold-pursuit-rev-0128-story.html)\r\n\r\n>The movie delivers, in its chosen way. But it’s a soulless way. The violence may be for laughs, and many Neeson fans will likely respond to the larky brutality of “Cold Pursuit,” which is very different from the star’s previous mid-winter vehicles (“The Grey” is my favorite). But I don’t get much psychic recreation from this sort of action movie. In the original, Stellan Skarsgard played the avenging snow angel, and with him, at least, you got the sense of a solid if vaguely unsettling citizen unraveling, by degrees, one killing at a time. With Neeson it’s different: He’s like the wedge at the front of his own plow, taking care of business efficiently, and not for a moment anything resembling human.','Cold Pursuit',14,25,'2019-01-29 00:22:36'),('akzklr','Video essay on the critical reception of \'Girls of the Sun\'.','Hi r/movies!\r\n\r\nSome of you might remember my partner posting my first youtube video to this subreddit last month.

Just seen it half an hour ago, so these are fresh-off-the-press thoughts. Also, SPOILERS, vague ones based off the trailers, just in case.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to cap off the trilogy, Hidden World jumps around all over the place, attempting to set up new plotlines, while calling back to previous ones, and yet not much happens in the movie itself. There’s no impact, unlike the first two movies, which spared time to slow down and allow the viewer to soak in the unfolding events. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the movie, when I took a short break from that unbelievable ending, I realized that everything else in the movie didn’t really stand out, or work for that matter. Main plot is quite weak, villain is pretty insignificant all things considered. Toothless’s romance with the Lightfury was honestly the more gripping plot, even with no dialogue in their scenes, so take that what you will. It does too many things at once, or at least puts screen time in the wrong scenes. And it’s a pity, because it diminished what could have been the best trilogy ending ever. But without much of a plot to build towards the ending, it just felt flat and uneventful.\r\n\r\nIt’s still good, and worth seeing for the stunning visuals, cinematography and musical score alone, but it could have been better structured.

My movie is the 1990s superhero comedy Mystery Men. It’s about a group of wannabe heroes whose “powers” aren’t that super. For example, Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) believes, all evidence to the contrary, that he gets stronger when he’s angry. Another character, The Shoveler (William H. Macy) hits criminals with a shovel, and my favorite character, The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), hurls silverware – forks specifically – with amazing accuracy. Still, they get a chance to be real heroes when Champion City’s favorite hero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is captured by his arch-nemesis Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), who is threatening to kill the Captain and destroy the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nI first saw the movie in college, and I still remember the pure joy I felt in the theatre during the opening scene. I remember squeezing my date’s hand and squirming with glee like a  kid, one old enough to drink. I had been looking forward to the movie since I’d watched the trailer in my school’s computer lab when I should have been doing classwork. The trailer was awesome, it was punk rock, and it accurately portrayed the movie as a stylish, self-aware comedy with a hip cast of smart comedians. Mostly, though, it was a deconstruction of the superhero genre, and it appealed to my youthful cynicism. But it still had the wow-flash-bang touches that spoke to something just under my freshly tattooed skin. Despite the combat boots, tongue piercing, and the philosophy paperback artfully shoved in my back pocket – I still loved superheroes and half wanted to be one.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe movie was everything the trailer promised and more. It opened with an aerial view of zeppelins above a futuristic city watched over by a statue of Captain Amazing. In a flash, we’re introduced to a different world, with an alternate history, superheroes, and people who want to be superheroes. Because if superheroes really existed, there would be imitators, right? Hell, I might have been one.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe camera’s eye descends, and we‘re thrust into a crime in progress. We see our misfit band of wannabes get their butts kicked by a gang of costumed criminals called The Red Eyes, who are robbing a retirement community. Our heroes are saved, and the villains stopped, by Captain Amazing, a real superhero. He had actual powers, a condescending air, product logos on his costume, a limo, and – according to his manager in the limo’s backseat – sponsors who are losing interest. It turns out the Captain is a little too amazing at his job and he’s run out of real villains to fight, and that’s bad for his brand. As the Captain says sarcastically to his agent, “‘Amazing Triumphs in a Nursing Home!’ That’s great copy, Vic.”\r\r\n\r\r\nRealizing the dilemma he’s in, and wanting his Pepsi sponsorship back, Captain Amazing, in the guise of his alter ego billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, pulls some strings to get his arch nemesis, the mad scientist Casanova Frankenstein, out of the asylum where he’s been imprisoned for the last 20 years. The Captain hopes he’ll once again have a worthy adversary to fight. But while the Captain is fighting for publicity, his nemesis is deadly serious, and unexpectedly, the Captain is defeated and held prisoner by the villain he unleashed. Casanova Frankenstein has spent the last 20 years in the asylum devising a plan to destroy Champion City with, as he explains to his henchmen, “a beautiful machine that is going to encourage our fellow citizens to share my vision of the future! Can you dig it?” The machine is a Psycho-frakulator, a weapon of mass destruction that when fired emits a beam that twists, warps, and ultimately destroys everything it touches. As it’s described by Dr. Heller, a non-lethal weapons designer and one of the wannabe heroes, “Hallucinations become reality, and the brain is literally fried from within.” \r\r\n\r\r\nDespite their apprehensions, our wannabe heroes now have a chance, and obligation, to fight a real villain, rescue their hero Captain Amazing, and hopefully save Champion City from a madman. But first, they have some work to do. They need to recruit allies, arm themselves with non-lethal weapons supplied by Dr. Heller, refresh their costumes, and most importantly learn to trust each other and their powers.\r\r\n\r\r\nI related to the band of misfit wannabes when I was a college student and in the years after, as I struggled to make my way as a creative guy with an odd grab-bag of skills: illustration, design, and caricaturing. Each of them, like me, were quirky characters trying to make something out of their very minor powers, poseurs striving to be like the heroes they admired and wanting a little admiration of their own. Most of all, like me, they believed they had something special to offer the world and just needed a chance to prove it. What college student, recent graduate, and scrambling young professional – particularly in the creative field – couldn’t relate? When we start out, it feels like we’re working hard and getting nowhere. We all just need time to learn to master our gifts, develop our powers, and trust ourselves.\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter a decade and a half of professional experience in marketing and advertising, my perspective on the movie changed. I found myself relating more and more to Captain Amazing. I’ve had big ideas and some “amazing” creative successes, but most campaigns fell short of what they could have been. As my career went on, I felt less like the misfits and more like Captain Amazing triumphing in a nursing home, with the continued pressure to have another win. As Casanova Frankenstein said to Captain Amazing, “I thought it was all about the publicity and keeping your sponsors happy.” Captain Amazing might not have wanted to acknowledge the truth of it – but he knew Casanova Frankenstein was right, and I do too. Both the Captain and I want to keep our sponsors happy. But most of all, I think the two of us crave a challenge worthy of our powers. \r\r\n\r\r\nNow, like the Captain in pursuit of that goal, I may have unleashed something that I’m not able to control, and something that may have captured me. Over the last year and a half, I started writing, or rather, rediscovered the joy of it. This newfound gift makes me feel more like Casanova Frankenstein, who declared: “I have something up my sleeve, and I’m not talking about the wart on my elbow.” I used to write - short stories as a child and for the newspaper in college, even journaled off and on – but in my late 20s, a death in the family put a stop to it. Writing in my youth took introspection, but with the loss came feelings I couldn’t face, so the only writing I did for over a decade was for ad copy and quippy headlines. \r\r\n\r\r\nThat changed just over a year ago, when I discovered a writing forum online that offered writer’s prompts. Without thinking too much about it, I wrote a few short stories of my own. The response was surprising. I received a flood of comments and personal messages, and the stories were shared widely online across a range of social media. Five of the stories were translated into German and Vietnamese, and 12 stories have been made into multimedia productions – nearly all of them multiple times by different artists. As of this writing, there are 40 productions of my stories on YouTube, iTunes, and SoundCloud, with four more in development. My anonymous stories have been seen by tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands. \r\r\n\r\r\nBut, I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I discovered I can write fiction. My writing resonates with a waiting audience. Still, the stories were written anonymously, and the subject matter is dark. The stories, while fictional, have deeply personal elements, some are admittedly disturbing, and if I go public with them, they have the potential to be a disruptive force in my life. It seems, like Casanova Frankenstein, that I too have created a beautiful machine. One I can’t seem to stop myself from using. \r\r\n\r\r\nI have, in a sense, already fired my Psycho-frakulator, and the beam is spreading. My stories have been read, my ideas unleashed. Now,  I have collected the stories into a book that I intend to illustrate and self-publish. A book I will promote with all the skills I’ve acquired working in marketing for the last 20 years. I think I’ll do okay. But, even if no one reads the book, the stories are already out there in the world. All that’s left for me to do is to claim responsibility for my ideas, embrace my madness, and for me to encourage others to share my vision of the future.

It has two very charismatic lead performances by Smith & TLJ, it has a rock solid pacing, I feel like everything flows together perfectly in terms of set up, confrontation and resolution, memorable side & alien characters and a very cool villain.\r\n\r\nI mean the movie spends quite some time with Vincent D\'Onofrio stumbling across and killing regular people and it\'s funny (and disgusting) together.\r\n\r\nBut I feel like the biggest strength of the movie is its balance of how much it takes itself serious.\r\n\r\nWhile the premise and storyline on paper is completely ridiculous, it never feels over the top and cheesy in execution.

So, we decided to see “The Nativity Story”, which was a good Christmas film. The lobby was warm, and there was popcorn for us to have.

They kept talking about friends at their jobs, who was dating who, and had their phones on full bright when texting or talking. Oh yeah, I said talking too. There were three phone calls in the movie and she took approximately 1 minute to answer each phone, and let us here her ringtone. Also, it was like shit version of mystery science theatre. There was only one time that I chuckled at them. There is an obvious shot that the wife is pregnant and one scene later where she’s listening with a stethoscope, one of the girls says: \r\n\r\n“Oh my God she’s pregnant?”\r\n\r\nThere was one point that they were talking so loud that I couldn’t hear the actual times that there was dialogue.

When Interstellar was announced, it was no different. I followed news about it very closely. I still remember when the first trailer released of Matthew McConaughey driving down his dirt driveway crying super hard with no context, it moved me by how powerful it was visually. \r\n\r\nI got to see the movie a few weeks before it hit theaters nationwide. They were doing a special pre showing in IMAX. This is definitely not the first movie I’ve seen in IMAX, but I feel like this is the first movie I truly got to experience what IMAX was intended for. \r\n\r\nI thought the movie overall was great. I still consider it one of Nolan’s best films to date. I think the writing is good, the acting is fantastic and I’m glad they casted McConaughey, the movie is shot very well and is enjoying to watch all the way through. But none of those were actually what made this experience so different for me. It was the sound. The choice to completely silence some scenes, really made a deep impact on me. I’m so used to going to movies and there’s nonstop sound the entire two hours. The idea of complete silence, or very little sound, in some scenes hit me super hard. I’m not sure if it’s because I never have really seen that done often, or maybe I was just ‘in the moment’. I remember one time during the movie I actually got tears in my eyes because the audio made such an impact on me. With no spoilers, I will say that near the end of the movie once McConaughey, uh, gets to where he was going I guess you could say, the choice to just have it to where you could only hear his character *falling* and breathing, was so brilliantly done and I believe the choice of not adding extra music or noise to that scene really hit the whole thing home for the audience. \r\n\r\nInterstellar is truly the first movie I’ve ever **experienced**, and still to this day no theater viewing has come close for me.

Idris Elba is a big bad motherfucker in this movie, altered by science to be stronger, faster, and almost nigh indestructible. So, it\'s going to take Hobbs, a brute force, rough and tumble plaid wearing man, and Shaw, a suave James Bond type guy who woos his way in with charm, or severely skillful ass beatings to take him down.!<\r\n\r\n>!The general plot of the movie will consist of both of their alpha personalities clashing, Hobbs will want to take one route to defeat Brixton which will be a more direct approach, and Shaw will want to take a more strategic route to take him down. They will argue quite a lot throughout the movie, insult each other, and pretty much do dumb bullshit to screw each other over whenever possible, kind of like the stuff The Hulk, and Thor did in Avengers, randomly hitting each other when the other is not paying attention type of stuff.!<\r\n\r\n>!All of this fighting with each other will eventually lead to them getting caught by Brixton, and that\'s when they get tortured for information, amongst other reasons. Eventually, they will grudgingly work together, escape the custody of Brixton\'s men, have some kind of high speed chase, or exciting fight that eventually either ends up with Brixton dead, in jail, or escape to go into hiding to have his revenge later, because fast and the furious likes to do the revenge thing a lot....!<\r\n\r\n>!Then the movie really ends with them having dinner with Dom Toretto in his backyard, wisecracks about baby oil or something gets made, and they live happily ever after digging into steaks...!<\r\n\r\n>!Does anyone want to disagree on this? lol!<\r\n\r\nI just wanted to get this out of my system, I could be totally wrong, but I think that\'s pretty much the gist of how the plot will go.

The acclaimed Film program draws thousands of fans, filmmakers, press and industry leaders every year to immerse themselves in the most innovative, smart and entertaining new films of the year.\r\n\r\nThis year’s program encompasses 131 Feature Films including 101 World Premieres, 9 North American Premieres, 3 US Premieres, and 64 films from first-time filmmakers,101 Short Films (including music videos), 5 Episodic Premieres, 12 Episodic Pilots, 25 Virtual Cinema Projects, and 30 Title Design entries.\r\n\r\nThe world premiere of Paramount Pictures’ *Pet Sematary*, directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, will close the 2019 Festival. Based on the seminal horror novel by Stephen King, *Pet Sematary* follows Dr. Louis Creed (Jason Clarke), who, after relocating with his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) and their two young children from Boston to rural Maine, discovers a mysterious burial ground hidden deep in the woods near the family’s new home. When tragedy strikes, Louis turns to his unusual neighbor, Jud Crandall (John Lithgow), setting off a perilous chain reaction that unleashes an unfathomable evil with horrific consequences.\r\n\r\nThe SXSW Midnighters section is a perennial favorite for SXSW audiences thrilled by the weird, electric, and sometimes terrifying selections. Featuring 10 genre films, all World Premieres, the slate includes dark comedies, thrillers, Sci-Fi, mystery and slasher horror from a mix of established and first-time filmmakers. The Midnighters, Festival Favorites, as well as 15 additional films, round out the 131 total features now to be screened at the SXSW 2019 Film Festival.\r\n\r\n“Programming the SXSW Midnighters section is always a favorite part of my job, and this year was no exception,” said Jarod Neece, SXSW Senior Film Programmer. “We get to peek into the collective consciousness of the world of genre filmmakers working today. This year’s selections are a mix of horror, thriller, sci-fi and fantasy with a good dose of feral children, haunted houses, extraterrestrial creatures and the undead to creep out SXSW audiences late into the night. Genre films can be found throughout the entire SXSW program, from Jordan Peele’s *Us* on Opening Night to our Closing Night Film, *Pet Sematary*!”\r\n\r\nThis year’s 101 short films and music videos were selected from 5,478 submissions. A comprehensive list of the Short Film Program is below and will screen as part of 10 curated shorts programs.\r\n\r\n“Welcoming these films and filmmakers into our community is a major highlight for me,” said Claudette Godfrey, Senior Film Programmer. “The work this year is contemplative and tender. In an uneasy era, these shorts show us how to connect across the abyss by exposing and embracing vulnerability through their originality, authenticity, and humor. Rightly so, over half of the films across our Shorts Programs, Music Videos, and Episodic Pilot Competition are directed by women.”\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Cinema section of the Film Festival continues to grow, showcasing the newest and most cutting-edge work. SXSW resides at the intersection of film and technology, and there is no better place to present this innovative format. The 25 projects emphasize storytelling, ingenuity and also showcase how other industries are embracing this new medium.\r\n\r\n“The industry leaders and independent creators working in the immersive arts are once again bringing their fantastical new worlds to SXSW this March,” said Blake Kammerdiener, VR Programmer. “This year’s selections showcase the breadth of ingenuity in this medium and will transport you to far off lands in both the smallest and largest ways imaginable.”\r\n\r\nSXSW Conference has announced separately many of this year’s Keynotes, Featured Speakers and Sessions in the Entertainment Influencers, Film & TV Industry and Making Film & Episodics Tracks, plus Convergence Tracks: Experiential Storytelling, Cannabusiness, VR/AR, Food, Media  & Journalism, Social and Global Impact and more.

On first viewing it was just sort of a mess to me.\r\n\r\nDease’s art is a test to find who is a true believer in art.\r\n\r\nJosephina, Gretchen, Rhodora, Morf, John Dondon, Bryson all react to Dease’s art by seeking to profit from it one way or another.  They die.\r\n\r\nThe survivors respond differently.\r\n\r\nDamrish quits Rhodora (profit) and goes back to being in a collective (true artist).  I think he gives Josephina a chance to turn towards art too.  He brings her along to the club where he meets his friends from the collective. Right after they break up, she dies.\r\n\r\nThe art museum staff push back against Gretchen’s demands for an exhibit that furthers *her* interests.\r\n\r\nPiers is inspired to start creating again.  Rhodora maybe bought herself some time by supporting him (telling him to stay at her beach house for as long as he needs to do good work).  But it wasn’t enough to save her. In the end she can’t bring herself to destroy Dease’s art as he wanted.  The tattoo from her true-artist days finishes her off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoco is trickier. I’m thinking she’s like Dease’s spiritual heir.  That’s why she gets his cat. That’s why she bails on the art world by leaving town.  Dease bailed by dying. Or maybe she is Dease’s instrument, and that’s why she blabs art world secrets and everyone who hires her dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nI fully acknowledge that this analysis might be duh\"\" to some people.  ?\"\"','Velvet Buzzsaw',18,10,'2019-02-07 21:14:31'),('aobtnz','Alita: Battle Angel\"\" Filmmakers Send Theaters Details For How Not To Mess Up 3D Projection\"\"','','Alita: Battle Angel',44,30,'2019-02-07 21:31:14'),('aocrpj','Was invited to an early screening of Alita: Battle Angel','I\'m not super into manga or anime; I\'ve seen the original Akira and Ghost in the Shell movies and not much else anime-wise, but Battle Angel is my favorite and has been since almost twenty years ago when I read the manga for the first time.

Mediocre storytelling, some uninteresting characters. \r\n\r\nVERDICT: You should turn your brain off and watch this in the cinema because Alita: Battle Angel is a good time no alcohol required. \r\n______\r\n\r\nI walked into this movie hoping for nothing more or less than an epic action blockbuster. I walked out of Alita: Battle Angel very satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe best aspects of Alita: Battle Angel:\r\n \r\n**The CGI.** Holy fuckin shit, the CGI in this movie is spectacular. The best thing about the amazing CGI in this movie is that it immerses you into the world extremely well. \r\n\r\n**The world building.** With the incredible CGI comes an incredibly engaging world that draws you into the movie. The rules of the world are extremely interesting and The looks service the aesthetic of the movie.\r\n\r\n**The aesthetic.** This movie is really well shot, well lit, and is all round visually stunning. The designs of the world are detailed and interesting, and there are shots that use lighting and colour fantastically, allowing your eyes to bask in the beauty that is this movie. \r\n\r\n**The action.** The insanely good CGI combined with the immersive nature of the movies world building and the great aesthetic of the movie produce some of the most exciting action sequences that I’ve seen in a long time. The action is well choreographed, well shot and so damn entertaining that you just can’t get enough of it.\r\n\r\n**The passion.** From a technological aspect, it’s clear that the filmmakers poured their heart and soul into creating a cinematic spectacle for the masses. Every frame of this movie is so meticulously crafted that it would be a waste not to watch this in the cinema. \r\n\r\nThe less impressive aspects:\r\n\r\n*The plot/story.* The plot is, on paper, actually quite interesting. However, it was not executed very smoothly. The story is not too hard to follow, but the pacing of the movie does make it jarring at times. It definitely feels like they tried to cram too much into one movie.\r\n\r\n*Some character interactions.* The romance between Alita and the guy wasn’t very convincing. Unlike her relationship with Christoph Waltz, which is actually really endearing and heartfelt, the romantic relationship between her and the guy felt kind of superficial. \r\n\r\n*Wasted actors/characters.* There are a few characters played by fantastic actors who I felt were kind of wasted. They didn’t play that large of a role in the movie and were largely uninteresting. \r\n\r\n','Alita: Battle Angel',0,3,'2019-02-09 10:27:11'),('aotg99','The \'Pet Sematary\' remake has a great reason for that huge plot change','','Pet Sematary',0,5,'2019-02-09 10:51:01'),('aotjw2','Millennials: Grown-Ups of the 21st Century - The Little Prince','','Little',5,6,'2019-02-09 11:02:01'),('aotrdu','James Cameron reveals title for new \'Terminator\' movie, \'Dark Fate,\' teases \'hardened\' Sarah Connor','','Terminator: Dark Fate',928,609,'2019-02-09 11:24:11'),('aovby0','Sonic the Hedgehog (2019)','If you\'re like me, you love great video game to movie adaptations.

Now a lot of people were like \'There wasn\'t any competition\' which I disagree with but even if that were true, that isn\'t fair. If they\'re going to say that the Oscars celebrates the best of the best, then they need to judge accordingly and the only way they can do that is if they watch ALL the films submitted.\r\n\r\nNow with 2018, I was for sure that Wreck-It Ralph 2 and Incredibles 2 would be the animated films to win. Then I saw Spiderverse. Everything about the film is phenomenal and thankfully, everyone else saw it too. For this film to be doing so well is a big surprise because I don\'t think anyone thought it would. And I\'m thankful that it\'s doing well because I think it\'s also sending a message to the industry that Disney isn\'t the only company that can do good animation while also showing that taking risks in animation is a good thing.

While I enjoyed the first film (I\'m a total sucker for the Groundhog Day premise) the plot was not remotely bulletproof. I am probably overestimating how thoroughly the writer will be capable of keeping his time travel consistent and semi logical. But, here goes nothing:\r\n\r\n**Reset Power Extended:** It seems like based on Fine Vagine\'s statement in the trailer explaining that he is repeating the day after dying that we have either an extension or transfer of the extra life ability from the first film. It also seemed like based on the shot of him waking up in his car, that he reset things to the same moment on the morning of the 18th as Tree does. (there seems to be a common save point)\r\n\r\n**What is Protecting People?**: While we can tell from the trailer that at least 2 people are capable of triggering the reset ability, it sounds like either there is a single totem that protects one person at a time or there are a select chosen few with the ability. I say this because there is that line where they indicate some of their friends have died and they need to intentionally cause a reset in order to revive them. If they learn to harness the reset ability, why not protect everyone they care about? Is it a single warding object of protection like the necklace? Or, can we eliminate that possibility because there was a timeline in the first film where Tree failed to retrieve the necklace before she died? Or was there a timeline in which another character died who was in possession of the necklace but did not trigger a reset? (like the killer ripped it off her or something) Just from the trailer, that seems unlikely because of the skydiving scene where Tree does not appear to be wearing the necklace when she jumps to her death.\r\n\r\n**Who Keeps Their Memory?**: With multiple people triggering time resets, how is this going to work? (I was curious about this in Edge of Tomorrow too) Presumably Fine Vagine gets killed, retains his memory, and tells Tree about his experience, who still retains her memories from at least some of the previous timelines. Is the rule that only the person that triggers the reset gets to keep their memory of the timeline in which the reset occurred? That would seem like a requirement or else Tree would have likely been very confused by a seemingly random reset (caused by the death of Fine Vagine) while she was simply walking around campus or something. This seems like it is both a very convenient mechanism for plot simplicity and at the same time a very inconvenient plot device because it is going to make information sharing between characters a pain in the butt. Maybe they can explain that away by showing them intentionally resetting the loop after information sharing so that they don\'t have to waste an increasing amount of time each day trading valuable learned information gained from previous timelines.\r\n\r\n**The Balls on a Killer Trying to Take Down a God:** There are multiple instances in the first film where the killer learns of Tree\'s god-like powers and yet continues to try to kill her. That seemed like a major stretch for a mere mortal who seemed only lightly motivated to kill in the first place. How on Earth is anyone going to stay motivated to kill an army of gods? Unless the killer is specifically on a mission to stop the time looping, motivation seems extremely tricky this time around.','Happy Death Day 2U',5,3,'2019-02-12 02:30:08'),('apsf48','Cold Pursuit- What did you think?','It was good.\r\n\r\nIt was much better than what I expected. The reviews weren\'t bad, and were pretty good as a whole, but I think it is a little underrated.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen a bunch of new movies and they have been really boring. You can try to get all technical and artsy with some movies, but sometimes you just have to get real and say if a movie didn\'t entertain you and made you want to fall asleep, then it wasn\'t that good, and was boring.\r\n\r\nCold Pursuit is fast paced and entertaining from start to finish. It has lots of good humor, quirky parts that are funny, and it\'s sort of like slightly below a Tarantino-type movie, which isn\'t a bad thing. It\'s still its own movie, but you do pick up on the style of Tarantino at times. It\'s a movie that is strictly entertaining from beginning to end, and I was on the edge of my seat and didn\'t want to miss a minute because it was so riveting.\r\n\r\nThe acting is good all across the board, even in the lesser known roles like the Indian chief and some side characters.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I had with it was the climax, just because it\'s the sort of conventional action movie climax, but then again it\'s 2019 and we\'ve seen it so many times through the decades.

The fox constantly got into trouble and annoyed the father to no end. The father, being the old fox he was, implemented a rule. Every day the fox wasted, the dad will reduce the lifespan of young one by one day. So, for the young fox, opportunity cost of wasting a day was not one day but rather two. This made the young fox smarten up and he started to use his days more productively. Young fox grew up and was successful. He had a cache of hunted prey saved due to his constant drive to “never waste a day” and hence decided it would be fear to take a day off. He thought he will request old fox not to deduct one day from his life. However, when the old fox heard his request, he laughed out loud. He said, son, I am a fox. The fuck I know how to reduce your life? If I could control life and death, wouldn’t I make myself an immortal. You truly are young. There is no moral of the story intended by the author.

Terry Crews definitely has the build that could fill out a body suit for a super hero pretty well. He got that Roman gladiator build that would just really be believable as a special forces soldier turned supernatural comic antihero. Obviously, I\'ve never met him in person, but if I did, I bet he could turn dirt into diamonds by crushing them between his pecs.\r\n\r\nTerry Crews has gravitas. He could really pull off the tortured soul damned to hell kind of look, without saying a single word. And really, I feel like the less words said, the better. Simmons/Spawn seems more the character to internalize his emotions. The person playing Spawn should really speak with his physicality and less so with words.\r\n\r\nI am so bad and selling this idea, I\'m sure some of you Shakespearean writers would have done a much better job of it than I.\r\n\r\nBut I believe in casting against type for unique characters.

[ Awareness post ]','So if you don’t know, the LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part has been receiving the lowest grossing so far out of the LEGO films. Usually, this wouldn’t be something to worry about, but the movie is also the most expensive out of all the LEGO films, with a budget of $100 Million. Now one may think if the film flops, it just means no more LEGO movies, but it means much more than that.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this could cause WB to dissolve the animation company for the LEGO movies, Animal Logic, costing countless people their jobs. It would be extremely cruel to reward their efforts for a beautifully animated franchise with a pink slip. Secondly, this could cost them movies that are already in the pipeline. \r\n\r\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Warner_Bros._Animation_productions \r\n\r\n16 different animated movies are in various stages of development, some of which include a Bone movie (based on Jeff Smith’s graphic novel), Space Jam 2, the LEGO Batman movie 2, and a plethora of animated films based on Hanna-Barbera shows. All of these films could very well be axed very quickly if TLM2 flops. Remember that Warner Bros closed their animated films department for 11 years after diminishing returns with Looney Tunes Back In Action, until restarting with The LEGO Movie In 2014.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest to you, please try to see the movie if you love animation, and maybe even if you don’t care if you see it or not. Bring the kids or whoever you’d like to have along to watch it. A large sum of jobs and possibly movies could be on the line over this brickfilm. As someone who watched the movie, I can be certain  you won’t feel it’s a waste of time, even if it’s not quite as mind blowing as the original.

A silent death machine that they cannot reason with or stop. They can only run. And I think that is what they are going to do with this new Chucky. I think he is going to be silent, for the most part. I believe that the only time we as an audience will be able to hear him is when the little boy is present.

[Alita: Battle Angel]','TLDR: The humans that emigrated to Mars evolved into big eyed Alita\'s due to Mars receiving 44% less sunlight than Earth. \r\n\r\nI remembered reading an article a while ago that humans located on the poles of Earth evolved to have 20% larger eyes than people living on the equator. This is due to there being less sunlight on the poles, and so the evolutionary response is to have larger eyes to capture more light for visibility ([http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2011/07/27/3279156.htm](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2011/07/27/3279156.htm)). Mars is about 50% further from the Sun than Earth, so it receives roughly 44% less sunlight intensity on its surface ([https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/9-12/features/F\\_How\\_Far\\_How\\_Faint.html](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/9-12/features/F_How_Far_How_Faint.html)). Therefore, my logic is that humans that live on Mars would evolve to have much larger eyes than those on Earth. \r\n\r\nAn estimation for how long Alita\'s people have been on Mars is >500yrs based on the manga\'s timeline (emigrated to Mars from Earth in 2009) and the rough timeline given by the movie (The Fall occurs in 2563). Would roughly 500 years be enough to evolve that drastically? I\'m no expert, so I\'m not sure. But my basic research understands that extremely high radiation levels on Mars would expect the rate of evolution to be 10x higher than Earth, possibly creating a new human species within only centuries. That\'s why there are many videos/articles depicting what humans would look like living on Mars for 1000 years, and the general consensus is that they would look pretty alien. Here are a few links in regards to this, some making similar comments on humans evolving to have larger eyes on Mars [https://youtu.be/FxrAe5N1xu0?t=301](https://youtu.be/FxrAe5N1xu0?t=301), [https://youtu.be/0q\\_B5X7PBHA](https://youtu.be/0q_B5X7PBHA), [https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/the-big-questions/mars-colonists-might-evolve-entirely-new-type-human-n708636](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/the-big-questions/mars-colonists-might-evolve-entirely-new-type-human-n708636). As for purely a fictional sense, the technologically advanced Mars people could/may have sped up that evolutionary process. \r\n\r\nNow before people start to jump on me, I 100% know this wasn\'t James Cameron or Robert Rodriguez\'s intention/reasoning. It\'s clear from their interviews that they merely wanted have a go at making Alita and the Mars people anime-like or true to the manga. As for the Author of the manga, I have 0 clue as to what their intentions were. But it begs the question, why did they illustrate the Mars people to have bigger eyes than the Earthlings in the manga?\r\n\r\nThis was simply my reasoning I drafted up for fun because I\'ve seen a lot of people bag out the movie for her eyes being too unrealistic etc, and so I wanted to offer up a realistic counter-view. I never watched any of the trailers nor read the manga before watching the movie, and so I was very confused about the eyes. The confusion lifted for me personally because of the reveal that Alita was from Mars, and so the useless trivia I remembered about sunlight and eye evolution made me accept the eyes as being somewhat realistic for the rest of the movie.

To distract themselves from career paths that are going nowhere (Daddario is kind of fired from a teaching gig for no good reason; Upton tries and fails to sell toxic North Korean cosmetics to some department store), they decide to take an impromptu girls’ trip. Something goes wrong with the plane and they end up stuck in St. Louis, with some hot blonde dude (best known for playing a character nobody liked on Fox’s Sleepy Hollow).

However, with Rocketman, a film that will be similar to Bohemian Rhapsody, coming out this year, I feel like no matter how good it is (or even better), it won\'t succeed as much. I mean, are we really going to go through everything that happened post release of Rhapsody? It\'s just too much, too soon. And it would then devalue everything that occurred with Rhapsody. And I feel like people aren\'t going to want to do that, so by that conclusion. Rocket man will probably go past like any other film. I understand that if this film is great, people aren\'t just going to not say anything, but it will always come back to how we just did this for Rhapsody. And if it is great, are we then to nominate it for best picture, given Taron Egerton a nomination (boosting his career), making the music of Elton John incredibly present again?

There was no improvisation at all in the film, but it seems as though there was because the dialogue is so organic. Excellent direction by the refreshing Marielle Heller channels McCarthy and Grant’s talent into the cutting script. I think my favorite aspect of the script (and by extent the film) is the casualness with which it addresses the climate of New York City in the early 90s. Specifically, the precise but normalized way it incorporates the stories of LGBTQ people living in New York at the time. Lee and Jack are both gay, and Jack has AIDS (he eventually dies from it in 1994). They hang around a known gay bar and don’t conceal their habits. We see Lee interact with women she has engaged with in past relationships as well as women she hopes to engage in future relationships. We watch Jack flirt with other gay men and bring them back to Lee’s apartment. It is quite refreshing and nice to see LGBTQ characters portrayed so casually but with such care.\r\n\r\nIt is a drama and it can be dark at times, but you do not pity Lee for a second; rather you begin to understand that this is the life that she wants because it works for her. Even if her relationships are practically nonexistent, it is because she has made it so. Every moment, every action is intentional and in that the viewer learns to love Lee Israel, in all of her bitter glory. The most particularly salient scene is that in which Lee is given the opportunity to say a few words in front of the judge before she is sentenced. Instead of becoming typically remorseful or dreary, she firmly states that what she did was her best work and that she is still extremely proud of it—regardless of its legality. There is not an ounce of apology in her monologue and it is so very fitting.\r\n\r\n[Can You Ever Forgive Me?](https://thefilmera.com/2019/01/07/palm-springs-film-festival-can-you-ever-forgive-me-review/) is a deeply intelligent and well-rounded film, reinforced by amazing performances from its lead actors and an impeccable script.

We didn\'t expect it and it\'s genuinely funny. It works because it parodies the trope of the villain over-explaining himself to the heroes for expositional purposes. Marvel clearly understood what made that scene work because they have used the same pattern of subverting the expectations of a scene by using comedy in so many of their other films in the MCU.\r\n\r\nBut now I think they are over-using it to the point where I expect any serious scene in a Marvel film to be immediately followed by an ironic joke.

It should have ended right after they kissed. Yet for some reason it continues and is ruined by a (in my opinion) stupid joke by Drax. Instead of leaving the audience with a bittersweet reflection of their relationship (along with some foreshadowing), the scene undercuts the drama with comedy. Why do this?\r\n\r\nTheir more comedic films like Guardians Of The Galaxy and Thor:Ragnarok are jam-packed with this kind of humour although it is more forgiving in these films as it fits the overall tone. But their more serious films like Black Panther still suffer from this such as here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAd-9GE0S98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAd-9GE0S98) where the joke feels awkwardly shoved in to stop the scene from being too dramatic or when M\'Baku yawns after T\'Challa reunites with his family.\r\n\r\nWith Captain Marvel and Endgame coming out this year, I fully expect this sort of humour to continue interrupting dramatic scenes.

I absolutely love this film and I think there’s a lot of people out there that may not have heard of it, but would really enjoy it. \r\n\r\nDescription from IMDb: \r\n\r\n>	A mysterious outsider’s quiet life is turned upside down when he returns to his childhood home to carry out an act of vengeance. Proving himself an amateur assassin, he winds up in a brutal fight to protect his estranged family.\r\n\r\nI’m not going to write up anything too in-depth, but I’d say even if you’re remotely interested in it, go watch it. It’s not your run of the mill revenge film. It’s a slow-paced, wonderfully crafted film with an excellent performance from Macon Blair. Also, maybe don’t watch it if you’re squeamish - the effects aren’t super exaggerated for the most part and are pretty realistic, very similar to Green Room. Definitely one of my favorites. \r\n\r\nI’m kind of a sucker for the whole “inept protagonist” schtick where the main character is clearly out of their element.

It\'s really amazing. It\'s got a whole new feel to the series, and it\'s great. New soundtrack, still amazingly delivered by John Powell. Beautiful scenery, and plenty of emotion (one of the only 2 movies I\'ve ever cried at!). \r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie made me feel so many things. The start was really cool, very cinematically pleasing (lol I\'m really trying sound smart- don\'t worry I\'ll get dumber later). The movie seemed to slowly get more and more emotional. As we see the hard decisions made, and the suspense with Grimmel. I love how he toys with the riders, furthering the suspense and giving a great look at his mindset. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we see the light fury out for the first couple of times and Toothless trying to flirt with her, that\'s just adorable. It made me happy, and eased the anxiety I\'d been feeling from the earlier bits. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t last long. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen toothless left with the light fury and went to the hidden world the first time, seeing the worry on Hiccup\'s face and his worrying about Toothless\'s safety, it just makes you worry the same, especially when we don\'t see Toothless for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiccup and Astrid go and find the hidden world, where the movie REALLY starts hitting you in the feels. You see all of these dragons flying around and fan-boying over the 2 night furies. Then you see Hiccup\'s face. He realizes that Toothless might not want or need them anymore. I nearly cried here, and it\'s not even the worst part. \r\n\r\n\r\nFast forward a lot, to where they are on the cliffs of New Berk saying goodbye.\r\n\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t do it. Just seeing these 2 characters bond over these last years, and seeing that they\'re gonna have to split. These 2 (Toothless and Hiccup) are together. They\'re supposed to be together. They\'re more than best friends, even. They\'ve been through so many things together, and the moment just conveys this further. Toothless really is going to leave after all this time. All of this evolution, maturation, and change we\'ve seen not only Toothless and Hiccup go through, but everyone else as well. It\'s just a sad moment. The tears on everyone\'s faces, the music, the scene, and all of the people taking their saddles off as Toothless and Hiccup look at each other for the last time for years. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the dragons flew away, I wasn\'t happy. I couldn\'t be. I knew it was a happy ending, but I still just couldn\'t be happy. I didn\'t want toothless to go. He had a personality and had bonded even further, I didn\'t want the movie to do me like that. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we see Hiccup again with a beard and his family, it\'s great. Then we see the waterfall to the Hidden World. The night furies on the edge. We see Toothless and his mate their with their children, and it\'s a great scene. But Toothless doesn\'t even recognize Hiccup or Astrid. You can see his pupils are slits again like in the first film before he\'d gotten to know humans. It was like he reverted back to his primal instincts in the few years they\'d been apart. I felt sad again.\r\n\r\n\r\nThankfully, he eventually recognized them when he sniffed, but Toothless almost DIDNT, and that would\'ve broken my heart further. Seeing these 2 bond over years and years of trauma and work together, only to be separated and one forgotten about the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still couldn\'t be happy with the ending, despite Hiccup\'s children touching Toothless like in the first film and them making up again. It\'s a beautifully happy ending, but it left a hole in my soul. I still knew that these 2 characters we\'ve seen throughout these amazing films will probably not see each other much more. \r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: This movie is so emotional in so many ways. Seeing the characters together and changing, it\'s gorgeous. Seeing Toothless and the light fury flirting, adorable. But then seeing the 2 characters we love most, Toothless and Hiccup, part ways. Regardless of how happy the ending was, it made me feel like there was a hole in me. Knowing these characters we\'ve seen throughout these films changing, maturing, and growing together end up splitting and not seeing each other again often is just heart-wrenching. I don\'t want Hiccup and Toothless to be apart, because they belong together. \r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to think they still visit each other every so often, but I\'m worried that\'s not the case. This movie has many amazing aspects, especially the ways the emotions are conveyed. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed this poorly-worded review of the emotions in this movie.

The robot anime bitch straight dunks on everyone. And honestly it doesn’t even look close. She straight rips that one Baby Driver chick in half and crushes her skull. Straight annihilation.\r\n\r\nI’ll give you that one scene where the dude chops her up. But she literally breaks her arm off in his eye and she gets avenged by a bunch of robot doggies.\r\n\r\nScene where a bunch of criminals and hunter gatherers are hired to kill her at Motorball tryouts? She literally gets warned that they’re all trying to kill her and had a 10 second break to leave and still stays. What happens? She DUNKS on ALL OF THEM. Only reason she even leaves tryouts is cause her bitch boyfriend needs saving. \r\n\r\nFinal push on Vector? No biggie, Alita just solo crushes like ten giant D.Va police robots and dunks in the dude who chopped her up.  Literally dunks his ass into two separate pieces.\r\n\r\nWhy’s Vector crying? Cause HE JUST GOT DUNKED ONN.\r\n\r\nCan we talk about how sick Vector’s death scene is??? His body is struggling like a dead fish in its final moments but the voice is completely unchanged since it’s Nova speaking through his body. That was so dope and such a unique death scene.\r\n\r\nI want, no NEED more protagonists like Alita. Doesn’t struggle. Just straight annihilates everything.

Carol Danvers’ final battle offers a radical message and becomes a powerful metaphor for what could happen if we stop waiting to be told that we are enough; if we stop believing the people who tell us we’re too emotional or too weak. *Captain Marvel* says that, when we stop looking for approval, we can become literally godlike. This is not another cheap girl-power cliché; it’s an explicitly feminist apotheosis. Some people will find it disorientating to watch. *Captain Marvel* offers zero concessions to ease anyone in or win them over to Carol Danvers’ point of view. If that makes it hard for some viewers to relate to her, she’ll deal.\r\n\r\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Todd McCarthy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/captain-marvel-review-1192277)\r\n\r\n>Still, the focus and big selling point here is Captain Marvel herself and Larson\'s impersonation of her. So what does a best actress Oscar winner bring to a performance as a Marvel superhero? Larson makes Carol/Captain focused, solid, ever-alert to what\'s going on around her, a quick learner, a determined and unafraid warrior. In other words, she\'s everything you\'d want and expect in a soldier, intergalactic or otherwise. But all of this is more or less prescribed by the role. What\'s lacking is humor, a hint that she might get off on the action and violence, or the indication of a deep desire or spark to ferret out evil and right the world\'s wrongs. The performance is fine, if not exciting or inspiring.\r\n\r\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/05/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson)\r\n\r\n>Larson has the natural body language of a superhero: that mixture of innocence and insouciance, that continuous clear-eyed idealism and indignation combined with unreflective battle-readiness, all the things that give MCU films their addictive quality. I wanted a clearer, more central story for Captain Marvel’s emergence on to the stage, and in subsequent films – if she isn’t simply to get lost in the ensemble mix – there should more of Larson’s own wit and style and, indeed, plausible mastery of martial arts. In any case, Captain Marvel is an entertaining new part of the saga.\r\n\r\n[Indiewire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/captain-marvel-review-1202048795/)\r\n\r\n>As much as this movie can be seen as a step in the right direction, it’s so eager to get to the promised land that it trips over itself right out of the starting gate. The first and most fatal mistake of the script that Boden and Fleck co-wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet is that it reduces Vers — or Carol Danvers, as she’s later and better known — to an amnesiac for most of her adventure; in other words, Captain Marvel is far and away the least compelling thing about “Captain Marvel.”\r\n\r\n[The Los Angeles Times - Kenneth Turan](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-captain-marvel-review-20190305-story.html)\r\n\r\n>But Marvel has come to recognize, as this film proves, that even effects-heavy behemoths can benefit from a directing touch that is human not programmatic, that understands character and nuance and can create scenes with an emotional heft we might not expect. As co-writers with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (with story credit to that trio and Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve), the directors also had a hand in the “Captain Marvel” narrative arc, which is far more complex than business-as-usual superhero origin stories.\r\n\r\n[IGN - Meg Downey](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/05/captain-marvel-review)\r\n\r\n>Captain Marvel manages to take the best ideas of early MCU origin stories like Iron Man and Thor and use them to form something that feels both familiar and fresh. It can be a bit on-the-nose at times, and occasionally has to fast-track its exposition in ways that can feel slightly clunky, but what it lacks in grace it makes up for in charm. Brie Larson\'s stellar performance gives Carol Danvers a vibrant, joyful life that will fit right into the future of the MCU, whatever that future may hold.\r\n\r\n[Screencrush - Matt Singer](https://screencrush.com/captain-marvel-review/)\r\n\r\n>It’s not at all what you would expect from Boden and Fleck, who are best known for character-driven indies like *Half Nelson* and *Sugar* that probe deep into the psyches of their heroes. In *Captain Marvel*, despite a scene where aliens *literally* probe into the psyche of their hero, they never quite licked the problem of a lead character who doesn’t know who she is until the film’s final act. And whether they had any input on the movie’s fight scenes or ceded them entirely to second-unit directors, those sequences are uniformly dark, murky, and disappointing. One takes place on a dusty planet at night. Another is set in a dimly lit spaceship. A third is in outer space. *Captain Marvel*makes *Solo: A Star Wars Story* look bright and cheerful in comparison.\r\n\r\n[Uproxx - Mike Ryan](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson/)\r\n\r\n>Yes, *Captain Marvel* is an origin story, but it’s handled in such a unique way that it doesn’t always feel like an origin story. With rumors of movies based on The Eternals out there, *Captain Marvel* also feels like the first big step to an even more cosmic MCU...Without a doubt, Brie Larson’s *Captain Marvel* is going to be one of the anchors of whatever phase of movies we are about to enter. And, if *Captain Marvel* is any indication, these movies are about to get a little more weird.\r\n\r\n[Vanity Fair - Richard Lawson](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review)\r\n\r\n>The 90s aesthetic is used to charming effect, particularly in the music choices. We hear Garbage and Hole, two riot grrrl groups whose propulsive, gnarly charge gives the movie some pleasant bite. (The on-the-noseness of No Doubt’s “I’m Just a Girl” during a clunky fight scene doesn’t play quite as well.) The movie has a good time with itself, but is not a relentless gag factory like *Guardians* or *Thor: Ragnarok*—though quite like those movies, *Captain Marvel* is pretty spacey. If your tolerance for kooky galactic names and actors in latex masks is low, *Captain Marvel* may prove trying.\r\n\r\n[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson-1203154542/)\r\n\r\n>The movie was directed and co-written by the team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (“Half Nelson,” “Sugar,” “Mississippi Grind”), and I’m not sure if there has ever been a case of filmmakers *this* indie commandeering the pop-art canvas of a Marvel movie. Boden and Fleck are low-key American neorealists, and in “Captain Marvel” they barely retain a vestige of their signature style. Yet they have brought off something exciting, embracing the Marvel house style and, within that, crafting a tale with enough tricks and moods and sleight-of-hand layers to keep us honestly absorbed.\r\n\r\n[The Wrap - April Wolfe](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-marvel-film-review-brie-larson-avengers-mcu/)\r\n\r\n>Larson’s energy, at first, is powered by a precocious kid-sister vibe, disobeying the rules but charming her way out of trouble. Carol’s arc is defined by shedding those bonds to that identity and to her mentor/father figure, speaking and acting with directness. Larson’s quite capable of selling that oscillation of maturity without losing the humor of her character; she may be confident, but she’s still crafty and calculatingly playful. And what really sells this film is that playfulness.','Captain Marvel',1021,3865,'2019-03-05 10:02:43'),('axmhdr','Godzilla King of the Monsters album of some new images.','','Godzilla: King of the Monsters',507,89,'2019-03-05 10:41:13'),('axo8sz','\'Fighting With My Family\' Cast and Director Talk About Sundance Film','','Fighting with My Family',0,0,'2019-03-05 13:13:43'),('axob4f','New international poster for Tim Burton’s ‘Dumbo’','','Dumbo',76,25,'2019-03-05 13:19:00'),('axot5w','From \'The Lobster\' & \'Killing of a Sacred Deer\' to A24\'s Upcoming \'After Yang\': Colin Farrell Is Continuing His Impressive Streak of Indie Success','','After',653,113,'2019-03-05 14:02:20'),('axsz83','International Poster for The Curse of La Llorona','','The Curse of La Llorona',81,32,'2019-03-05 20:27:31'),('axszdv','New MPAA/CARA ratings/reasons for the week of Wednesday, March 6, 2019.','**PG**\r\n\r\n1.	**Aquarela** (DOCUMENTARY) (rated PG for some thematic elements.)

Jackson\'s character Nick Fury was digitally de-aged using controversial CGI technology in the new Captian Marvel film and this marks the first time a major character has been de-aged for the entire duration of a film. This is probably the most ambitious use of the technology that we\'ve seen thus far. Marvel\'s use of digital de-aging has been quite good in the past. Michael Douglas in Ant-Man and Robert Downey Jr. in Captain America: Civil War were both breathtaking, although the effects were only used in short scenes. \r\n\r\nAs good as they were, the human eye is still extremely good at catching imperfections in other human faces and the characters still looked ever so slightly off in those films. The clips I\'ve seen of Jackson in Captain Marvel have been superb, but I wonder how the technology holds up when the character is portrayed as 30 years younger for an entire film. Perhaps someone who has seen the movie in full can attest to the quality and accuracy shown. This also begs the question of how digital de-aging might be utilized in future films by other studios. \r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese\'s The Irishman is slated to use he technology on Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, actors with even more screen time than Samuel L. Jackson had in Captain Marvel, for the first half of that film.

This isn\'t meant as a bashing of their content since I\'m a big fan of some of their shows. \r\n\r\nRecently, I tried watching Hold the Dark since I\'m a huge fan of Alexander Skarsgard and I think Jeffrey Wright is a good actor. It seemed like a solid premise and a setting perfect for a sort of survival thriller. Boy was I disappointed with the average story and unengaging action scenes. I finished the movie but just because I felt obligated after more than an hour waiting for any real arc. Thus began my aversion to Netflix originals. \r\n\r\nNext I tried Sand Castle which didn\'t look too promising, but since it was an action movie I expected engaging action scenes. Nope. I turned this one off about 30 minutes in and I almost never give up on movies.\r\n\r\nToday I watched Triple Frontier because how do you mess up that cast? Started off on a boring foot and stayed that way throughout the film. Even the action scenes seemed to be directed by a robot with all the necessary inputs for an action movie but no actual flavor. Very disappointed since I was looking for a decent story and action scenes that drew me in. Blandfruit all the way. See the stickied review post for opinions that I echo. \r\n\r\nI know Netflix is churning out content because what else are they going to do?

It\'s nowhere near as good as the first two and the novelty factor has kinda worn off, but it\'s still a good film nontheless. I was apprehensive, before I watch this movie, because I hoped to all the gods that this wouldn\'t be another cash cow project like the abomination called Kung Fu Panda 3, because that series  had two amazing movies before that. The second movie being just as good if not better than the first. The same could also be said of the HTTYD trilogy, except they didn\'t dumb down the final movie for just kids and spam silly pandas for eons for a quick cash grab. That\'s why I think the HTTYD series is far better than KFP, even though I liked KFP1 & 2 individually more.\r\n\r\nHTTYD 3 - Still delivered an okay villain, albeit a sneakier one with a more specific and smaller goal as opposed to a world ending one. At least that\'s what it felt like as this arc was pretty much based all around the night furies. It still managed to deliver on the cute scenes and didn\'t try to over do it to appeal to one nation like KFP3, not did it throw away most of it\'s cast to the side for 90% of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe part where the lightfury saves Hiccup right after she saves her nightfury is somewhat unrealistic and unbelievable, as I\'m not convinced that she could have saved Hiccup in time, but I\'m sure that scene can easily be changed somewhat. As the movement needed for Hiccup\'s hangtime struggle with the villain was way too long.\r\n\r\nI\'m am a little confused however as to why Hiccup never invented some kind of parachute in case Toothless cano\'t reach him and his slider is broken, because that\'s what my head cannon prefers. The fact that hiccup can instantly release his gliding harness when needed and then hit a button or something to release his parachute.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I\'m going to give a critique, it can\'t all be good. As I would have liked to have had the villain to have a deeper and more fleshed out backstory. Plus, I\'d like to have seen some character development for Hiccup\'s crew. It just seems that only Hiccup and Astrid are the only ones that grow up.','How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World',2,9,'2019-03-14 22:43:59'),('b19lv1','[OPINION] Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is such a great movie title and here’s why','So I wasn’t gonna make a post about this except I keep having recurring thoughts about what a great movie title this is so eventually I decided why not talk about it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I think Tarantino is one of the best at coming up with titles for his films anyway (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Death Proof, The Hateful Eight) - they all just sound so cool!*.\r\n\r\nNot only that though, but generally Tarantino titles don’t let you know much about the movie, other than the genre. You couldn’t deduce anything of the plot from Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, Death Proof etc. To me a good movie title does what a good trailer does, which is to make you interested, but keep you in the dark for the most part. Sure you know this is probably gonna have something to do with the film industry, but if you hadn’t read up about it you wouldn’t know to what capacity nor would you know anything about specific plot points or characters. \r\n\r\nLet’s also not forget that it serves another purpose, which is to pay tribute to the Sergio Leone epics Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In America - something which he did briefly with the naming of the opening chapter of Inglourious Basterds: “Once Upon A Time... In Nazi-Occupied France”. \r\n\r\nI’m also really hoping that this will be Tarantino’s “epic” in terms of scope and ambition, and that it will receive something like a 3-4 hour runtime. I know when he moved from The Weinstein Company to Sony one of his demands was something like “extraordinary creative control” which included something along the lines of final cut and a disregard for regular runtime regulations.\r\n\r\nApparently this had over 100 sets built just for it and will feature many different storylines, and as many of his films with much simpler plots (at least on paper) and far fewer characters still have had runtimes of 2hrs 45 and upwards of 3 hours, I wouldn’t be surprised - especially with his new editor (R.I.P. Sally Menke) - if he just did away with the small amount of self-restraint he usually shows and instead just goes all out like a kid playing in a sandpit.\r\n\r\nI just think Once Upon A Time In Hollywood has such panache and sounds like a QT movie title. When it was originally reported that the film would be called Helter Skelter, I remember not believing that would be the finished title because it just didn’t sound Quentin enough.\r\n\r\nI’ve even seen some articles report it as Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood, so we’ll have to see if that’s actually the case with the ellipses (IMO they take it just over the edge and into self-indulgence territory).\r\n\r\nAnyway, online rumours are spreading that the trailer’s meant to drop next week, so I guess we’ll find out then. I just thought I’d share my love for the title in the hope it might give even one person just a tiny bit of extra anticipation for it.\r\n\r\nMost movie titles struggle to sound this stylish and this intriguing, at least to me, so let me know if you feel the same way!\r\n\r\n*left Inglourious Basterds out because it’s a homage to a film called The Inglorious Bastards, so not really his title.\r\n\r\nEdit: Spelling.','Once Upon a Time in Hollywood',1,8,'2019-03-14 22:59:22'),('b1b7gu','Photograph Review: A delicate little gem','','Little',6,2,'2019-03-15 02:01:31'),('b1boce','The Worst Part of Risky Business','In my quest to educate myself on some of the movie classics, I knew I would have to watch Risky Business at some point.

As a current high school senior, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!

I think they all did well and were definitely the best part of the film. With that said, I felt like the movie as a whole was really badly paced.\r\n\r\nSPOILER AHEAD.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to talk about the ham fisted attempt at making the audience emotional with the death of Davis (played by Affleck) despite them making him an unlikable character throughout. That\'s not to say Affleck did a bad job, but I definitely think the writers were going for that. It felt like the writers were going to make him an antagonist that would eventually betray or attempt to kill his fellow soldiers, but decided against that at the last minute without changing any of what they had previously written in regards to him being some sort of antagonist. Then they decided to kill him off and spend the rest of the movie about getting his body home above all else, and once they get home, all the money they had made is given to his family despite them risking it all to obtain that money in the first place. It just doesn\'t make sense to me.\r\n\r\nAlthough with that little rant over with, I did think there were redeeming qualities such as the execution of every intense sequence with my favorites being the initial robbery and when they try to (unsuccessfully) defuse the tension with the villagers.\r\n\r\nOverall I\'d say it\'s an okay movie, but I definitely feel there was a ton of wasted potential with the amazing cast they had.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what do you guys think?

Thoughts?','#Madagascar 1:\r\nThis film is a metaphoric piece, rising from the depths of Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell\'s mind. Themes like identity (In Marty) and mental illness (Melmon), as well as acceptance (Gloria). These trifector call back to images of the Holy Trinity, completely different, and yet the same. But then, there\'s Alex. Alex is the antithesis of Marty, prehaps showing the Alex is a metaphor for the Devil, or Satan, he consistenly pretents to be Marty\'s friend, only to let him down.\r\n\r\nThis is a clever comment on both religion, and how those who may pretend to be your friend, can be the reason for events which could span an entire cinematic triology. And yet, Marty forgives him.\r\n\r\nThen, there are the penguins, I originally thought that the penguins could be a metaphor for Stalins\' tenure in power from 1928, with one figurehead leader taking control over an established and well oiled machine, and using it to exert his own will and beliefs onto others, until he (similar to the Secret Speech given by Khrushchev in 1956) is proved to have been wrong. However, I see it as a more take on figureheads in general, and whilst referencing the USSR is a way of doing this, the end story of the penguins has a horrific twist. \'Skipper, don\'t you think we should tell them the boat\'s out of gas?\' This line broke me, they had fought for so long, and yet they had failed. A very human concept, juxtaposed by these silly, humourous penguins. And these penguins themselves embodying autocracy and juxtaposing King Julian.\r\n\r\nJuilian is both a metaphor for gay rights and the monarchy. Whilst scary and demanding Juilian is still charming and flamboiant, despite being initally seen as \'different\' to the majority, is a fundamental, imporant and amazing part of this series.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film has so much subtlety, disgused as an animated kids film, Black Panther and Moonlight means nothing compared to this. This is an important film.\r\n\r\n#Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (WIP)\r\nThis time around, Alex is faced with the same themes he mocked Marty for in the first piece. Forced into becoming a King of Lions (Or a Lion King for short) Alex is made to fight. However, after seeing every awful thing this character does, he defies it. The role of Lion King is taken away by a darker mained villan, with no resemblence at all to any other copyrighted character or movie. Alex is forced into Marty\'s shoes, and then is humilated further, by not being able to tell Marty apart from any other Zebra.\r\n\r\nThis could either be a comment on the short sighted-ness of humanity, only caring about vague details, and not caring about the important (if tiny) details, another theroy is that of race, and, linking back to Madagascar 1, sees how the Devil is reborn in those who are racist.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Gloria and Melmon have to deal with themes such as racial bias (Gloria falling in love with a thicc hippo, the same race with her) and suicide (Melmon falling into depression, attempting to sacrifice himself for her happiness) these two definately take a backseat in this plot, which I feel is intentional, representing how society forces these issues aside to focus on the trivial tasks such as personal fame and identity.\r\n\r\nThe penguins and Julian are here too. One of the penguins tries to mate with a doll too.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts and criticisms are welcome.\r\n','Penguins',7,23,'2019-03-16 18:07:13'),('b1z277','It’s late but can someone walk me through Xavier Dolan’s It’s Only the End of the World?','So before everything else, I’m not a native English speaker so I think I really missed something but I just want answers.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing about the stage play it was adapted from, I’m kind of lost after watching the film.

Not everybody knows about this place of rebirth; not everybody would agree to use it if they knew. And there\'s a compelling mix of fear and poignancy in the reunion of a surviving family member and one who isn\'t quite as alive as you\'d hope. Unfortunately but not fatally, the movie soon makes this reanimated loved one more monstrous than unsettling, possessed of unlikely strength and a little too similar to the growling monster-people found in garden-variety horror films. A more eerie approach would have been welcome, and more in keeping with what Church has taught us to expect from those who come back from the hilltop. \r\n\r\n[IGN - Jim Vejvoda](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/17/pet-sematary-review)\r\n\r\n>Whatever one’s feelings are on the original film, though, this new Pet Sematary stands alone as a gripping piece of horror entertainment marked by strong performances, an ever-escalating sense of doom, and, as the movie crosses firmly into the ghoulish, a delightfully dark wit. Skillfully directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, who previously directed 2014\'s Starry Eyes, Pet Sematary quickly establishes a pervasive sense of dread that extends from the otherworldly woods of the titular burial ground to what should be the safety and sanctity of a family home.\r\n\r\n[Indiewire - Britt Hayes](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/pet-sematary-review-stephen-king-jason-clarke-1202051608/)\r\n\r\n>For much of the runtime, the directing duo confront grief and guilt in a manner that resonates deeply; familiar as viewers may be with the source material and Lambert’s take on it, Kolsch and Widmyer manage to subvert those expectations to deliver an unnerving exploration of death and its emotional effects. That approach may appear heavy-handed to fans of both the novel and the 1989 movie — as are winks and nods to King’s bibliography — but this “Pet Sematary” is more effective than the previous adaptation, at least until the climax. It’s in the third act that Kolsch and Widmyer’s ambitions get the best of them. The macabre poignance of the first two-thirds of the film swiftly devolves into silliness, ending on a note that is neither heartbreaking nor horrific. That’s a shame, given the 80 or so minutes that preceded it\r\n\r\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/pet-sematary-review/)\r\n\r\n>Kölsch and Widmyer, along with screenwriter Jeff Buhler, have a blast playing with our expectations. They’re well aware that most of us will know this story, either from reading King’s novel or seeing the 1989 movie. But the fun – and fear – comes when those expectations are subverted. We may *think* we know where this story is going, but *Pet Sematary* has plenty of shocking tricks up its sleeve. The end result is a film somehow darker than the book itself, which at one point seemed impossible. King’s novel is notoriously bleak – so bleak that the writer himself felt he had gone too far when he wrote it, and originally considered throwing it away rather than publishing it. But the new *Pet Sematary*pushes the envelope, and then some, going further than King even dared. The fact that this is a studio film is both surprising, and thrilling. The producers have allowed Kölsch and Widmyer to go down some twisted paths, and dig up something considerably nasty.\r\n\r\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/pet-sematary-review-1203165096/)\r\n\r\n>The movie is disconcertingly efficient in laying out the essentials of its plot — four minutes in, passing gas trucks are hurtling down the deadly street in front of the Creeds’ new home, and three minutes later, Ellie has set foot in the “pet sematary” — but sacrifices the kind of eccentric personal details King uses to connect (or repulse) us with the characters he’s created, along with the more introspective look at grief and loss that made the novel’s ludicrous story so effective. The script, from “The Midnight Meat Train” writer Jeff Buhler, is practically all plot, all the time, which is plenty efficient for those simply looking to be scared but a little anemic when it comes to making audiences care about these people — all of whose deaths are intended to be seen as not only shocking but tragic.\r\n\r\n[The Warp - Monica Castillo](https://www.thewrap.com/pet-sematary-film-review-2019-stephen-king/)\r\n\r\n>I quite enjoyed the thrills of the new “Pet Sematary,” much like I enjoyed the scares of the old movie. Its terrifying story about death still leaves audiences with much to think about long after the credits roll, and the twists that lead to a new ending are fun to follow. Thirty years after the original movie frightened audiences, its source material has given new life to one of the best Stephen King adaptations in the past decade.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;','Pet Sematary',397,245,'2019-03-18 08:14:22'),('b2ibcb','Poster for Quentin Tarantino\'s upcoming \'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\'','','Once Upon a Time in Hollywood',71024,3560,'2019-03-18 08:47:14'),('b2j719','\'Transformers\' Producer Says \'Bumblebee\' Follow-Ups Will Have A Little More Bayhem\"\"\"\"','','Little',5,23,'2019-03-18 10:12:27'),('b2l1lb','‘Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark’ Documentary Gets July Release Date and Home Video Art','','Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark',305,15,'2019-03-18 12:51:42'),('b2le1z','What song do you think will be used in the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood trailer?','Quentin Tarantino is known for his amazing taste in songs and often does great work with his trailers.

One of the scenes I recall (the ending?), the artist/painter realized what was happening, so he tries to protect himself by storing his self-portrait in a safe. Consequently, he starts to suffocate, so he removes it from the safe, places it out in the open in his studio then runs out of the studio (chasing a girl?). Somehow a fire breaks out in the studio, paint thinner lands on the painting and it smears/smudges the painting and moments later, he\'s ran over by a car and his ran-over face/body resembles the state of the portrait. Several people die throughout the movie in this fashion, but I don\'t recall any of it.\r\n\r\nI\'ve tried to google this several times, but to no avail.

Bob Odenkirk as a sort of inbetween of Martin Sheen and The Current President works. Seth Rogen plays his default role, and it fits. O\'Shea Jackson Jr turns in yet another golden supporting role.\r\n\r\nThe writing is also pretty solid at times, taking pretty standard modern comedy tropes and making them interesting due to the situation they\'re in (Theron, high as a kite, doing a hostage negotiation is the high point of this movie).\r\n\r\nBut...there\'s something else about Long Shot. It has one of the worst cold opens I\'ve seen recently. Attempting to shove Rogen\'s usual character into what feels like the intro to a mid-90s Harrison Ford or Robert Redford thriller where you see a terrorist group just felt rough, unfinished, and tonally super-off from the rest of what you see in the rest of the movie.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the movie makes a point of taking Theron through the obvious (and needed) steps of showing what problems there would be in her campaign planning and trying to be taken seriously (even though she has a Fields Medal and a Pulitzer by this point). Everyone commenting on her looks and concentrating on that instead of her policies? Yep. Being propositioned because she\'s single? Definitely. Having the establishment stand in the way of her policy planning? Yes.\r\n\r\nIt\'s all standard, and it all works.\r\n\r\nBut then, out of nowhere (and just to cause friction between the two leads), Andy Serkis\' turn as Not Rupert Murdoch wanders back into frame the fifth or so time to reiterate all of the stakes and challenges so far.\r\n\r\nIt feels unnecessary, especially when you have a president with already-known buffoonery and corporate interests and an already extant clash standing in the way of her endorsement and thus the presidency.\r\n\r\nBut even more than that, the whole affair feels like a pretty solid globetrotting PG-13 romcom with two great leads and a solid supporting cast that decided it *needed* to be R rated even though a sum total of two scenes would have pushed it to that point sans language.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Watch *Dave*, it\'s a far better movie','Long Shot',6,0,'2019-03-20 13:55:40'),('b3fob5','Excited about the Hellboy reboot?','I was wondering if someone was really looking forward to see this movie.

Initially, Tom Hanks and Johnny Depp were supposed to headline the movie, but as the years went by and development on the movie halted, both Hanks and Depp backed off from the project.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Netflix finally bought the rights to the movie and got the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nTriple Frontier or Tres Fronteras is the point in South America where the borders of Brazil, Peru and Columbia meet. The movie revolves around a group of former special force operatives who reunite to plan a heist on a drug lord’s safe house.\r\n\r\nBen Affleck, [Oscar Isaac](https://www.gq.com/story/oscar-isaac-spring-suit), Charlie Hunnam, [Garrett Hedlund](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabenyehudarahmanan/2019/03/07/triple-frontier-stars-charlie-hunnam-and-garrett-hedlund-talk-netflix-supremacy-and-more/) and [Pedro Pascal](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/56895/8-reasons-why-narcos-season-three-surpasses-its-previous-seasons/) collectively portray the Special Operatives, namely Tom “Redfly” Davis, Santiago “Pope” Garcia, William “Ironhead” Miller, Ben Miller and Francisco “Catfish” Morales. The heist, which seems like a simple in-and-out job, goes terribly wrong when things slowly start to spiral out of control, leaving them all battling for survival in South America’s rugged terrain.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s exterior might showcase it as your average heist gone wrong action-thriller with an overload of machismo and an overly dramatic brothers in arms theme, but *Triple Frontier*– while being all that – goes a lot deeper. The fine line that separates the good guys from the bad ones soon starts to fade, and our lead characters end up questioning their own morals, as well as those of their partners.\r\n\r\nThe movie also stands apart from other heist movies because most of the story takes place after the heist itself, leaving the audience to witness the characters’ downward spiral.\r\n\r\nHowever, where *Triple Frontier* goes right in its plot, it goes wrong in its character development, or lack thereof. The characters of Hunnam, Pascal and Hedlund in particular are barely developed onscreen, making it hard for the viewer to connect with them as much as they do with Affleck and Isaac.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the heist part itself of the movie seems quite rushed in order to get to the post-heist confusion, which is why we don’t get to see the planning aspect that usually makes up a huge part of heist movies and brings in most of the fun.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the strong performances by the entire lead cast, especially [Affleck](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/78673/the-battle-of-the-batmen-why-ben-affleck-should-return-as-the-caped-crusader/), transcend the movie from just another heist film. Affleck’s Redfly is a father struggling to make ends meet with his pension, which is why he agrees to join the plan as he desperately needs the payout. Affleck perfectly fits into the shoes of a father who is willing to go to any length in order to secure a future for his children.\r\n\r\nIsaac’s portrayal of a man who can see his plan going awry and who then carries the burden of failure on his shoulders is quite commendable. Meanwhile, Hunnam and Pascal are TV heavyweights and known for their intense portrayal of characters, which they do here flawlessly.\r\n\r\nThe movie also makes use of great practical effects; a breath of fresh air given the [CGI-ridden movies](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/32621/gods-of-egypt-an-empty-cgi-spectacle/) common in today’s age. The actors even trained with and used live ammunition rounds in the filmmaking process instead of using blanks, the way it is done most of the time and you can tell the difference. Such an approach is what makes *Triple Frontier* fresh and authentic.\r\n\r\n*Triple Frontier* may be somewhat derivative, but it does offer a new approach to heist movies and that is what makes it a standout among countless other similar movies in Hollywood. The extremely talented ensemble cast paired with intense action sequences and an exciting screenplay ensures that *Triple Frontier* is looking solid on all fronts.\r\n\r\n*Triple Frontier* is streaming now on Netflix.\r\n\r\n[https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/80368/triple-frontier-is-a-refreshing-and-authentic-take-on-heist-movies/](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/80368/triple-frontier-is-a-refreshing-and-authentic-take-on-heist-movies/)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;','Triple Frontier',1,18,'2019-03-21 08:12:07'),('b3q9cu','Dora and the Lost City of Gold\"\" Teaser Poster\"\"','','Dora and the Lost City of Gold',3409,802,'2019-03-21 09:01:56'),('b3qrut','Tarantino\'s \'Once upon a time in Hollywood\' is the only film in the next two years that I can look forward to.','For someone who detests superhero movies and doesn\'t believe that classic disney films should be remade live action, I feel my love for movies is slowly dying away.

Will Smith\'s could-have-starred-in list sounds way more intriguing than his actual filmography.\r\n\r\n1. SNAKE EYES (1998)\r\n\r\n>Smith was set to co-star with Nicolas Cage in the Brian De Palma-directed film. He would have played the role of Commander Dunne, which eventually went to Gary Sinise. Smith passed on account of not being offered enough money.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n2. THE MATRIX (1999)\r\n\r\n>Johnny Depp was the Wachowskis’ original choice to play Neo in The Matrix, but Will Smith was offered the part at some point in the casting process. In 2004, he told WIRED that he had no regrets about saying no to the film, explaining that, “The Matrix is a difficult concept to pitch. In the pitch, I just didn\'t see it. I watched Keanu \\[Reeves\'\\] performance—and very rarely do I say this—but I would have messed it up. I would have absolutely messed up The Matrix. At that point I wasn\'t smart enough as an actor to let the movie be. Whereas Keanu was smart enough to just let it be. Let the movie and the director tell the story, and don\'t try and perform every moment.”\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n3. K-PAX (2001)\r\n\r\n>“I loved, loved, loved \\[the script for\\] K-PAX”, Smith admitted to MTV. “But it never really jelled in my mind. I always wanted to make that movie.” Kevin Spacey, who was originally offered the role of the psychiatrist (later played by Jeff Bridges), stepped in and played Prot instead.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n4. OSMOSIS JONES (2001)\r\n\r\n>The live action/animation hybrid was planned to have featured Smith as the voice of the titular character. After script issues and conflicting schedules forced Smith to leave the project, Chris Rock took the role.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n5. PHONE BOOTH (2002)\r\n\r\n>Colin Farrell ended up playing Stu Shepard in Joel Schumacher\'s claustrophobic thriller. Smith claimed he “loved” the script, but passed because the “bad guy’s story wasn’t clear enough.”\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n6. THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE (2002)\r\n\r\n>In Jonathan Demme’s remake of Charade (1963), Mark Wahlberg portrayed Lewis Bartholomew/Joshua Peters, a role originally played by Cary Grant. Smith was offered the part, but declined in order to star in Michael Mann\'s Ali (2001) instead. Which was a smart move, as Smith was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, whereas Charlie was ignored by awards shows and audiences alike.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n7. MR. AND MRS. SMITH (2005)\r\n\r\n>Originally the title roles were to go to Brad Pitt and Nicole Kidman. Kidman had to leave the project when The Stepford Wives (2004) went over schedule. When Kidman left, Pitt also dropped out, leading director Doug Liman to consider pairing Will Smith and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then Johnny Depp and Cate Blanchett. When Pitt stepped back in, it was going to co-star his ex-fiancée, Gwyneth Paltrow. Then Angelina Jolie came along.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8. DJANGO UNCHAINED (2012)\r\n\r\n>In 2013, Smith claimed that he turned down the titular role in Quentin Tarantino\'s slave-turned-vigilante epic because he believed that the bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) was the real star in the film. In 2015, he said he wanted to make the movie more romantic—“I wanted to make the greatest love story that African-Americans had ever seen.” Despite not seeing eye-to-eye with the writer-director, he said he thought the movie was “brilliant.”\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n9. BATMAN FOREVER (1995)\r\n\r\n>Will Smith claimed he was in the running to play Robin in 1994 prior to it going to Chris O\'Donnell.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n10. A STAR IS BORN (2018)\r\n\r\n>In the early 2000\'s, Joel Schumacher was reportedly developing a remake of A Star Is Born with Will Smith and Jennifer Lopez. Early rumors reported that the roles would have been reversed with Will Smith as an up-and-coming singer and Jennifer Lopez pushing him. Nothing came of it and when Bradley Cooper signed on for director, the rest is history.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow, it got me thinking. What movie would have been better with Will in it? Not that it would have been better but I would have loved to see Will Smith in the recent Triple Frontier (2019) alongside the original cast, which included Christian Bale.

Starting with Infinity War last year, they started only having certain locations and IMAX screens show the movie in the IMAX 3D format. Then less screens around had it for Antman 2. \r\n\r\nCaptain Marvel tickets went on sale two months in advance and we found out they weren’t doing ANY imax 3D showings in all of North America. You had to decide (before knowing how much of the movie was in IMAX ratio) which version you wanted to see: just Imax 2d, or real 3D in a normal theater, or 2d Dolby. We saw it opening in imax 2d and had fun but something lacked. We saw it again that weekend in normal 3D and liked it a lot more. \r\n\r\nInfinity war and Endgame are filmed entirely in Imax format. But the trailer that came out and tv spots show the separate formats listed, making us think they will pull this shit again and make you choose which version you want. I don’t understand why they have started to change to this format, if the movie was filmed in all of them. Why can’t we have IMAX 3D versions anymore? How are we supposed to know which is best if we haven’t seen the movie yet? \r\n\r\nI know a lot of people don’t like 3D but we do, I just feel more immersed in the movie and if it’s an action or comic book movie it just makes it better to watch for me. But tomorrow’s possibly the day and we have no idea which to choose from, and don’t wanna be left in a scramble and lose tickets/seats. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any insight into why they are doing this?

I don\'t blame him for how the movie ended up.)\r\n\r\n2. Danny Boyle\r\n\r\nI love his kinetic style. His movies never feel so and moves at a fast pace and I never feel lost or miss anything. The use of color in his movies really stand out for me. And plus, the soundtracks to his movies are always a plus.\r\n\r\n3. Quentin Tarantino\r\n\r\nAs violent and crazy most of his movies get, his dialogue always stands out above that. From Pulp Fiction to The Hateful Eight. To even True Romance which he didn\'t direct, the dialogue is always on point and very memorable. I cannot wait for *Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.*\r\n\r\n4. Edgar Wright\r\n\r\nThis man has not made a bad movie. I cannot wait for his next movie *Last Night in Soho*. His movie is full of so much energy and is always an entertaining watch. The editing in his movies is always a huge highlight as well. His use of music is fantastic whether in Shawn of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World or the entirety of Baby Driver, his movies are never boring.\r\n\r\nSo, I know we all are going to have different picks.

This happens in LotR, Harry Potter and the MCU. There are other instances but I want to talk about those three. \r\n\r\n\r\nGandalf will just push Saruman against the wall and then Saruman will throw Gandalf around the room. How is this being done, telekinesis or some kind of magic? We never know. The same thing happens in HP they just shoot these beams of light out of there wands will little to any explanations as to what they might do. HP does go deep into spells and potions but they are never really used in fights with characters countering each other. It tends to be two big beams from each wand clashing in the middle, it\'s the same stand off is used all the time in HP and it gets boring. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow I want to bring up Anime which does fantasy the most and the best. In their battles powers and abilities are explained a lot and how a seemingly unbeatable ability has some kind of weak spot the character has to find. Examples that have great writing with powers and battles are Naruto and JoJo. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can skip this part of you want, I\'m going to give some examples. In Naruto Hidan is immortal, you can stab his heart, or cut off his head and he will not die. He is impossible the kill and our heroes have to find a way to beat him. Another ability is if he licks the blood of an opponent off his blade then when he stables himself the injury goes to the other person. (This causes a main character death) Shikamaru devises a plan to defeat the immortal Hidan, he puts him under shadow possession jutsu so Hidan is forced to copy what ever Shikamaru does. He uses this to take Hidan to a place in the forest where he planted paper bombs. Hidan then cuts Shikamaru\'s face and stabs himself in the chest. Shikamaru takes no damage since he put another enemies blood on the blade tricking Hidan into injuring his own ally. All the paper bombs are blown up, Hiden is in pieces, then he falls into a deep whole in the ground where he is buried by rock so he will never get out. He is still alive but he can never reassemble his body and fight again. This is the kind of writing I like in fantasy were abilities how to be countered in some complicated way. Also having Hidan immortal makes him feel like a very big threat even though he is a short lived character in the series. \r\n\r\n\r\nContrast this will Harry Potter where they shoot spells and block them with no explanation then suddenly this spell kills a character. Why couldn\'t he block it like the other spells and attacks, this stuff isn\'t explained. Same goes for the MCU, Thanos has the Reality Stone and Time stone and can use then to what seems no end. It would be so much more interesting is he has to learn how to use the reality stone and there is some limit on what he can do with it since he only just got it. But no he can make guns into bubbles with no explanation. And that battle with Thanos and Dr Strange looked cool, the problem is I don\'t feel anything, there is no tension and I have no scene of who is winning or losing in the fight, it is just unexplained special effects. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn Naruto you think Shikamaru will die when Hidan stabes himself since is ability has been established. This makes you feel that Shikamaru is about to lose, but surprise Shikamaru uses Hidan\'s ability against Hidan\'s ally. I specifically love this fight because Shikamaru is a physically weak character and can not preform crazy feats of strength like other characters do. He has to use his brain and come up with a strategy to defeat a much more powerful enemy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another example from a JoJo fight I wanted to use. There is a Stand, it\'s the spirit of the users which has powers. It has the ability to attack someone from inside a mirror. Polnareff can not attack this stand since his stand can not enter the mirror. This is very well done since how can Polnareff attack something like this. He ends up drawing the stand into the desert where there are no mirrors. The stand is now jumping from the reflection in peoples eyes. Since Polnareff knows the few options for the stand to jump from reflection to refection. He predicts where the stand will go next. This allows Polnareff to attack the stand in the middle of going from one reflection to another, defeating it in the end.  \r\n\r\nWhat I\'m curious about is why don\'t hollywood movies have writing like this in battles? It\'s all fancy effects but who is winning and loses doesn\'t exist since the audience has no idea what they are even using to attack each other and what attacks are more powerful. What do you guys think of fantasy battles in Hollywood movies compared to anime? And what American movies have complicated power systems that are explained like the examples I gave? I have yet to find any.','The Best of Enemies',0,22,'2019-03-25 12:03:38'),('b5d1r8','‘GLOW’ Star Betty Gilpin Set For ‘The Hunt’ From Universal & Blumhouse','','The Hunt',216,69,'2019-03-25 12:46:30'),('b5e149','Under the Silver Lake is a mess but it has something to say about incel culture','','Under the Silver Lake',0,9,'2019-03-25 14:00:10'),('b5f7m3','Shazam is Actually the First Movie Superhero','','Shazam!',0,7,'2019-03-25 15:32:29'),('b5ia6o','Plots used to be driven by real-world conflict, but now they revolve around domestic drama.

The message was that even a lowly peasant from the middle of nowhere could rescue a beautiful princess and confound an aristocratic villain. But the sequel, “The Empire Strikes Back”, revealed that Luke was the son of that aristocratic villain, Darth Vader. And the third film in the trilogy, “The Return of the Jedi”, added that he was also the brother of the beautiful Princess Leia.

But I think 3 years is a solid gap and not the 5 we get now.\r\n\r\n\\- Connery IS James Bond and there\'s probably nothing that\'ll change that. He also has the hottest streak of good to great Bond movies (for me from Dr. No, FRWL, Goldfinger & Thunderball).\r\n\r\n\\- Still, I actually love Daniel Craig\'s interpretation of Bond and Casino Royale isn\'t only my favorite Bond movie, but also in my opinion one of the greatest movies ever made. SkyFall is also top tier, especially at how gorgeous it looks (apart from BR49 this is maybe my favorite of Deakins work this decade).\r\n\r\n\\- I\'d like to call Brosnan\'s Bond Rambo wearing a suit. His later movies may be considered generic action flicks but they sure deliver some memorable and engaging action sequences (apart from DAD which, you know, obviously has these atrocious VFX). GoldenEye though is something special and at least for me a masterclass in action.\r\n\r\n\\- Roger Moore holds the title for most Bonds and that\'s totally fine. The cheese in his movies ranks from working really great (TSWLM), to fine (TMWTGG, LALD), to really bad (last two ones). Lazenby is well Lazenby, OHMSS is a good film but he\'s just too wooden for me to be Bond. Dalton is actually really good, and both of his movies, especially LTK are solid thrillers. I think he should\'ve done at least one more.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2:** I was not counting Connery‘s „unnofficial“ Bond in the 80s\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this?','The Tomorrow Man',22644,1592,'2019-03-27 04:56:09'),('b63vj2','New ‘Toy Story 4’ UK Poster','','Toy Story 4',1082,117,'2019-03-27 08:28:32'),('b6471b','THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE 2 International Trailer','','The Angry Birds Movie 2',0,2,'2019-03-27 09:00:50'),('b64x6c','The Angry Birds Movie 2 - Trailer','','The Angry Birds Movie 2',3,5,'2019-03-27 10:07:50'),('b65e42','Harmony Korine\'s The Beach Bum is running a voicemail promotion: Call 1-844-BUM-LIFE for a daily dose of Moondog wisdom.','','The Beach Bum',303,47,'2019-03-27 10:57:55'),('b664gw','The Professor and the Madman | Official Trailer','','The Professor and the Madman',8,5,'2019-03-27 12:14:51'),('b66epp','‘Downton Abbey’ Official Poster','','Downton Abbey',1140,113,'2019-03-27 12:37:26'),('b66ri9','Netflix and Mötley Crüe Being Sued By Crew Member of Biopic \'The Dirt\' - He Suffered Severe Burns and Foot Amputation Due to On-Set Accident','','The Dirt',530,119,'2019-03-27 13:05:46'),('b67uue','The Dirt (2019) : Why do I feel like I have seen this movie years ago?','Was there a trailer out,about 10 years ago that had all the key scenes in it?

We had some science exhibition come and freeze a flower then smash it. That was the greatest thing ever. Now imagine if that happened to a persons face. Imagine no more cos this happens in the masterpiece of Jason X. \r\n\r\nEveryone loves horror/sci fi crossover films, like alien, event horizon. Well imagine those movies but except good. Cos this one has a machete wielding maniac. \r\n\r\nThe movie gives us a look into the future, like 2001 a space odysee. But this time with a nipple less robot woman. That’s cooler than anything Kubrick came up with. \r\n\r\nThe social commentary is quite pointed. We need to look at the advancements in modern society and in particular modern medicine, and whether this will be for the betterment of society as a whole, with our world nearing its limit for how many people it can sustainably handle. This is brilliantly shown in the movie by having technology turn Jason into “Uber Jason”. The only thing more dangerous than him is a half machine version. \r\n\r\nIt also has wholesome Christian family values. When the two topless girls say to Jason “we love pre-marital sex” before they climb into their sleeping bags, he does what god would have done in the Old Testament and pick up the sleeping bags and hitting them repeatedly into a tree.

Plus the catacombs in Paris seems like a super cool spot to film a horror movie because of how claustrophobic it is down there and how easy it is to get lost.\r\n\r\nSo as i said before, the concepts of As Above, So Below really fascinate me, Vitriol, philosopher’s stone, dante’s inferno, etc. The whole movie is pretty much a modern retelling of Dante’s Inferno, the deeper they get into the catacombs represents the gates of hell, where they bumped into The Mole is Limbo, as he’s just wandering around suffering. Where Papillon is sucked into the ground upside down with his feet sticking out of the ground is how they buried Heretics in Dante’s Inferno.\r\n\r\nSo, I don’t really know what to call the things discussed in the film, maybe hell/ demonology or the occult?

Disclaimer, I have gone about two days without sleep now so I\'m functioning pretty poorly, please forgive any errors, grammatical or otherwise, in this post. I welcome disagreement and discussion, I normally do this with my friends but I recently moved to a new city and presently don\'t have any (locally).\r\n\r\nSo the first thing I noticed was the obvious license for interpretation that the film presents the viewer with, some of the murders to me were quite clearly delusions, for example the police car explosion, whereas others were a little more vague, like the murder of Paul Allen. I think this neatly ties in with the narration that went along the lines of \'the insanity is seeping through the mask of normality\' early on in the film, I think the ambiguity is immerses the audience into the mind of Patrick Bateman. \r\n\r\nI think that the murders tended to be less mindless than they appeared (now assuming that all murders were genuine for the sake of argument), they were instead the result of resentments or envies of Bateman. Notably the murder of the homeless man was in my opinion a broader message about class, the wealthy bait the poor with offers of wealth and then criticise them for not having a job and ultimately care very little for the health or well being of the lower class. The murder of the prostitutes aligns well with the opinions that Bateman and his peers have on women, when they consider and intelligent woman to \'keep her mouth shut\'. The Allen murder was obviously out of jealousy, which Bateman likely told himself was ambition. \r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting characters to me was Jean, obviously Bateman resisted his urge to murder her and then proceeded to protect her by encouraging her to leave. To the more interesting aspect of that relationship was that Jean listened to Bateman, changing her work attire when he delivered his bittersweet, deeply misogynistic criticism of her work attire. In contrast to Bateman\'s other relationships, where he can say literally anything without so much as a semblance of care, this one actually touched Bateman. I also noticed that in the last scene she was featured in Jean had returned to her usual trousers for work, still trying to work out what this means but one of my guesses is that since Bateman wasn\'t present in this scene her change to a skirt was actually a delusion of Bateman\'s, he believed that she would have internalised what he had said when she actually had likely thought he was a pompous arsehole. \r\n\r\nAfter his conversation with the lawyer at the end I was left a little confused, was it suggesting that Bateman was that insignificant that even his lawyer didn\'t recognise him. Or, had those in positions higher than him arranged for a cover up and viewed him as the bosses son, a character who has to be tolerated and accommodated due to his family connections. Furthering this does this movie suggest that (within the fiction of the movie) that this is a common thing?\r\n\r\nI have probably missed a few parts, as I say I\'m way too tired to be doing this but I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. I also thank anyone who read all this way down.

Kneeling in front of him is an American, bloody, beaten, bruised, with their hands tied behind their back. They try to plead and bargain with the man, but he says he can do nothing until he gets the call- which he gets while explaining this. He nods, flicks the safety off his gun, and caps the American, then says it’s done.” Margin notes around this one stress sound design and engineering.\r\n\r\n“Cut to White House. A crisp and clean gathering in the Situation Room is tensely waiting for the news, which Secretary Riley delivers after hanging up. It’s pretty grim, as a deep cover operation in southern Mexico is close to being blown wide open. There’s a bit of sharp back and forth about what should be done, before Sec. Riley sighs angrily and says they all know what needs to be done: break El Chapo out of prison. A general asks if they call him for the job, closeup on Riley, nod.” Margin notes say lookalikes.\r\n\r\n“Cut to a diner, busy and happy, focusing on a waitress as she works; after a moment it’s revealed her next customer is Gillick. They chat for a moment before Gillick tells her he needs her for a job. Waitress is nervous and dances around it, eventually caves. Montage of the two planning as conversation winds down, Gillick heads off to New York.” Notes indicate there’s some kind of unresolved tension between Gillick and his waitress friend.\r\n\r\n“New York, dark; tense breaking and entering sequence, followed by waitress removing ski mask briefly to confirm the papers and hidden thumb drives are really there. Things go great, but as she gets ready to leave through the window she’s stopped by a gun cocking behind her. Slow pan, it’s John Wick. John asks a question, doesn’t like the answer, safety off. Asks another, waitress cryptically lets him know she’s working with Gillick. She hints at possible deals being worked out, John doesn’t care for those deals, waitress drops the name of the American- a former coworker of John’s. Closeup on John’s gun hand, he puts the safety back on and asks what he can do.” Margin notes have a few contacts for research for who I’m assuming are actual B&E experts, indicate a developing tension between John and the waitress.\r\n\r\n“Day of breakout. John and Gillick’s inside contacts are at work in the prison preparing things, small stuff that will let everything break the way it needs to. Waitress and Gillick make it in, disguised as doctors. El Chapo then has a heart attack while Waitress and Gillick are attending to him, Gillick throws a pretend fit over his incompetence as a doctor, and leaves with Waitress to take El Chapo to the ambulance. John is the driver, and Waitress uses her chemical knowledge to revive El Chapo in the ambulance. Gillick gets a call; it’s Graver, who lets him know he’s rigged the ambulance with explosives that are set to detonate if it goes below 60 miles an hour. John says not again; Graver lets it slip this is his once chance at redemption for his previous actions. Quickly Gillick orders Waitress to strap herself and El Chapo to the gurney so he can push them out and split up.” Margin notes have a need for one-liners and carefully used tense pauses.\r\n\r\n“Waitress cuts herself and El Chapo out of the gurney, and they slink off through the alleys. A car pulls up, and black man asks if Waitress could use a ride. Waitress asks to be taken to location a few blocks from the meeting place, and she and El Chapo get in. Not long after, the man takes what looks like a wrong turn, Waitress objects, and asks the black man who he is. Man says driver; El Chapo asks for who, Raymond Reddington looks over his shoulder from the passenger seat and says for me.”  Margin notes have a few specific street names for a route during this scene.\r\n\r\n“Cut to chase scene in the ambulance. Gillick is leaning out of the window firing at their pursuers. John asks who knew, Gillick says his bosses know everything. John says median and bushes, and immediately he floors it and they both open the doors and jump. Slowmo on Gillick as he fires, during the jump he sees Miguel is the driver. They share a look as their car rolls by, then Gillick stands and walks away as the ambulance explodes on it. He meets up with John as the shooters and Miguel get out, returning fire; Miguel is the last one left, and Gillick hesitates before tagging him in the shoulder and running.” Margin notes stress the music and fast cuts during this scene.\r\n\r\n“Gillick and John arrive at the meet-up house and walk in to find Waitress tied to a chair. Gillick is about to run over when Reddington, Dembe, and El Chapo walk around the corner. Some tense exchanges; Gillick needs El Chapo to come with him, John wants waitress freed. El Chapo ask Gillick if he’s heard of the Wisdom of Quetzalcoatl. Gillick says he doesn’t believe in fairy tales, and then Reddington and El Chapo take turns explaining the history of the artifact and why they need it: a plot that goes all the way to the top is trying to steal it to extort the Mexican government, and Reddington needs El Chapo to stop it, he’ll let Waitress go if El Chapo comes with him. John looks at Waitress and Gillick and says to untie her, El Chapo asks why, John and Gillick say at same time because we’re all coming with you.” Margin notes talk mainly about a montage when explaining the Wisdom of Quetzalcoatl, tossing out a few possible locations and a song the music should be inspired by; it also makes a special mention of how Waitress looks at John in this part.\r\n\r\n“Travel montage; El Chapo voiceover of how he found the Wisdom early on and built his empire out of the surrounding area to protect it. They get to the temple; it’s rich and wild rainforest, and they gear up and head inside. With El Chapo’s guidance they find it without too much trouble, but they hesitate before removing it; Gillick quickly and carefully snatches the ancient book off of the altar and puts it in the container. As they make their way out, the ground starts to rumble and they hear explosions, El Chapo says he knows he had the traps disarmed. They make it out to shouting and gunfire, turns out the American black ops are already there. Dembe take the Wisdom off to safety as the group tries to get cover and prepare to fight back. Some of El Chapo and Reddington’s men go down, but they dig in and once the group is ready, things slowly even out. It’s bloody and chaotic, and both sides get picked off one by one, until just the group and one cell of the Americans remain. Gillick catches a flash of one of them through the trees, and tells the others to follow Dembe while he covers for them; they hesitate but go after a second, Gillick screaming as he unloads on the Americans. He manages to pick them off but also takes a few shots. He calls out for Graver, who materializes from behind a tree. The two talk about freedom and being patriots, and then there’s a gunshot over a pan of the forest. Cut back and Graver drops down, dead; Gillick turns and starts away, but then stumbles, and rolls onto his back, staring at the sky. Fade to black.” Lots of margin notes, including a few names of consultants for the Wisdom of Quetzalcoatl’s book design and its contents, a few more location ideas, and a couple alternate ideas for the final few shots. The music is another central point, I think it even mentions I’m Going In, by Jon Brooks, possibly even as the main theme of the movie and credits, which would have pic-in-pic shots of the Wisdom of Quetzalcoatl.\r\n\r\n“Post-credits, peaceful and completely normal suburbs.

Isabel is reluctant to put down her snack and phone to do so, but she does, wondering if it’s really her uncle and if trouble is coming. Her dad hands her a box to take in while he and her mom get the truck better sorted, and once Isabel sets it down inside, she looks up in shock. It’s Gillick, and after a moment, the two embrace.” The margin notes say to keep Isabela and del Toro apart until this scene is filmed, and how the music needs one final subtle touch over the otherwise dry and blank set to seal the deal.','What Men Want',0,2,'2019-04-01 01:27:46'),('b7y8a2','What if Danny Buried his frozen Dad in The Pet Semetary','','Cats',0,5,'2019-04-01 02:04:52'),('b7z9xv','The upcoming movie, Crawl\"\" seems very interesting.\"\"','The upcoming Horror movie \'Crawl\' sounds very interesting.

It was a movie I had heard all about. One of the critics I followed loved it (Chris Stuckmann) and it was talked about all around the community. I knew I had to watch it. But since it wasn’t in cinemas when I wanted to watch it, I had to buy a DVD (I didn’t have and still don’t have a blu-ray. Plan on buying a blu-ray player and ‘Your Name’ again). There was a lot of build up to watching this movie, since it took a little while for the movie to actually get to my house. But then on that day, on the 20th of April, I finally watched it.\r\n\r\nI don’t think I can explain my experience through words. There was something about this movie that just clicked with me. Whether it was the characters or the story, something about it just… did something to me…\r\n\r\n‘Your Name’ follows Taki and Mitsuha, two high school students who live on two very different parts of Japan, one being in the middle of Tokyo and one being in the country. One day, the two strangers switch bodies with each other. With Taki in Mitsuha’s body, and Mitsuha in Taki’s. We get to see how Taki and Mitsuha have to change their lives for each other. We see them grow and change through this body switch.\r\n\r\nI am a person who likes to have everything in a movie to be as great as possible. I want the characters to be good, I want the story to be good, I want the visuals to be good. I want everything in a movie or show to be good. Now, this has lead to me thinking more about movies with my head rather than the heart. It has lead to me rating a movie/show lower cause I realized that the characters weren’t that memorable. It has led to me not feeling anything, cause I was just thinking.\r\n\r\nIf I look back at this film, it never feels as good as it does when you watch it. I look at the characters, and the story, and the music separately which leads me to slowly dislike the film. It’s not that I realize things about the aspects that make it worse, but just some weird feeling that it isn’t as good as I thought.\r\n\r\nBut when I watch this film, there is just something that happens. I’m completely engrossed by its story and characters, that it is hard to see some of the mistakes. Cause there are mistakes and flaws in this film for sure.\r\n\r\nThe characters could’ve had a little more depth, the story had some holes and the third act felt a little slower than the rest.\r\n\r\nBut whenever I actually watch the film, all of those flaws disappear in my head. The characters feel real and I’m invested in the story. I don’t think I can explain through text how much I love this movie. But I’ll try.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of ‘Your name’ is how its story and characters have a connection. It doesn’t feel as if they wrote a story, and then wrote characters. They never felt separated but were completely connected. That the characters develop through this body change that occurs multiple times under the film. That Mitsuha and Taki learn about their desired lifestyle. How Mitsuha learns how stressful the life in the city is or how Taki learns about culture and connection in the country (it is never stated that Taki dislikes his life in the city, but it was something I wanted to add since Mitsuha shows the stress that is in the city). That Taki doesn’t do anything with his life until Mitsuha changes that, and how he repays her by saving her life.\r\n\r\nOr how the story has themes of what the Japanese society is becoming. That they are drifting away from culture (religion) and into modernization and politics. About wanting to keep a balance between culture and modernization. A whether you should uphold tradition, or be yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd how all of that being connected with the dreams that the main cast experience, of how they get to see how their wished lives would’ve been. They get to see whether or not it is their culture or their dreams they want to take force in their future. Whether they want to continue to live the life they have lived all of their lives, or if they want to make a risk and maybe feel a little uncomfortable but in the end live a better life.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think the characters and story both embody the constant struggle between the two sides.\r\n\r\nBut then there’s also the constant feeling of looking for something that might fulfill themselves that is referenced. Whether it is a person, a place, or even just a job.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of movies and shows that have a character or a plot element that I find relatable. But this the first time I felt the same about a feeling expressed in a medium. Maybe I explained it badly. The feeling of trying to find something that might fulfill yourself is something I think everyone has felt. Or maybe not even fulfill, but just trying to find something, cause you have the constant feeling that you need to find it.\r\n\r\nI can’t believe I have gone through this review this long without mentioning the art.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of shows and movies I would consider visual masterpieces. Like ‘Spiderman into the spiderverse’, ‘A Silent Voice’ or Ridley Scott’s ‘Alien’. And while I would still consider them a few of the most visually appealing movies of all time, there is something about ‘Your name\\* that makes it so beautiful. Whether it is the incredibly detailed backgrounds that fit so incredibly well with the fantastic, or if it’s the coloring that brings the emotion so well together with its shading. It is a mystery I have yet to solve, but want to keep a secret. To have something to have unexplained.\r\n\r\nAnd I can’t not bring up the music. Wow, what an amazing score. The work by ‘Radwimps’ is honestly something I admire completely. It is one of the few soundtracks that I almost remember completely. It is what makes many of the scenes into what they really are. It’s what makes so many of the scenes bone-chilling. It’s what makes so many of the scenes so marveling.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I absolutely love ‘Your Name’. It is a movie that I think I will have in my mind for all of my life. A movie whose score will be stuck in my head for eternity. A movie who’s visuals will be ingrained in my brain. And a story of which will be cemented into my soul.\r\n\r\nI have seen movies that I think are as good as Your name. 2001 a space odyssey, a clockwork orange are both two movies I think are about as good as this film. But in those two, it is more the thought-provoking and complicated story that they have. They aren’t necessarily movies that are made for the heart, but are still amazing for it. But when I watch ‘Your Name’, something about it just grabs me. I don’t know what it is, but the first time I watched it, I loved it completely. But I don’t know how to describe it. It isn’t a sad film, not necessarily a realistic one nor a romantic one. You could probably describe in many ways. but for me - it is the unnamable. Nothing more, nothing less, than a beautiful film\r\n\r\n[https://letterboxd.com/artistwithaname/film/your-name/2/](https://letterboxd.com/artistwithaname/film/your-name/2/)\r\n\r\nEdit: I’m honestly so glad I made this (these) posts. Whether it is negative or positive, I’m just glad that people are talking about Your Name again. I never really wanted to do a review of it, but I’m glad I did!\r\n\r\nEdit 2: And last thing. I can go on and on about why I love this film. I can analyze every aspect of it. But the fact of the matter is that there is just one thing that makes me love it so much. Cause it makes me happy. I haven’t really felt that good for the past years. I’m not sad, not happy, I just feel an emptiness where my feeling should be. But whenever I watch this film or listen to it’s score, I’m happy. Or at least I think I am. I can feel a warmth inside of myself when I watch it, and I think that’s it. It has problems, but it makes me happy every time I watch it.

No one in the class had seen the film before, and all of us had no idea what to expect. As the film went on, most of my classmates got more and more unsettled; during a particular scene involving spaghetti and a bathtub, a few people had to look away in horror. By the time the credits rolled, several students said, “Thank God.” A few people outside were talking about how much they disliked it, calling it exploitative and disgusting. All I could say then was that I thought I liked it, but I didn’t know why. Like the rest of his filmography, Harmony Korine’s *Gummo* is so separate from what most people think of as “cinema” that it’s easy to dismiss it as trash. Yet, under the initial reaction of shock that comes with watching *Gummo*, *Julien Donkey-Boy*, or Korine’s other feature films lies an almost sincere and kind empathy for the forgotten or ignored people of America: the poor, the drug addicts, the mentally handicapped, the bizarre and the absurd.\r\n\r\n[Full writeup](https://thefilmera.com/2019/04/02/absurdity-within-america-the-films-of-harmony-korine/)','The Beach Bum',3,6,'2019-04-02 11:01:29'),('b8kfth','Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile | Official Trailer','','Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile',1573,316,'2019-04-02 11:09:11'),('b8kvci','Poster for “Joker” with Joaquin Phoenix','','Joker',61166,3152,'2019-04-02 11:43:27'),('b8lihu','New Poster for Netflix\'s Ted Bundy Biopic \'Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile\' - Starring Zac Efron, Lily Collins, Jeffrey Donovan, Haley Joel Osment, and John Malkovich','','Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile',833,141,'2019-04-02 12:33:14'),('b8m61','i need suggestions for an art project i\'m working on. who were some movie \'badasses\' from the 70\'s?

It stems from, well, Ned Flanders, who started off as a more well rounded character and became a one dimensional christian joke over time.\r\n\r\nAnyway what are some examples for you?\r\n\r\nBoth Dumb and Dumber sequels, both When Harry Met Lloyd and Dumb and Dumber To. In the original, Harry and Lloyd were obviously stupid, it\'s literally called Dumb and Dumber for a reason, but they were stupid to a point, as dumb as they were, there were definitely things even THEY would be too smart to do or there would be things even they noticed. For example, Harry noticed him and Lloyd were struggling to make ends meet and was trying to get Lloyd to be more safe with money. In the sequels, however, their stupidity is really, really exaggerated, if something is stupid, they\'ll do it no matter what it is.\r\n\r\nSame thing kinda happened with Sid the Sloth in Ice Age 2, though in a different way. In the original, he was an idiot but he was still a mostly nice guy and never said anything really malicious or mean. In Ice Age 2, he is apparently so stupid he  keeps making fun of Manny the Mammoth\'s sadness about possibly being the last of his kind and he dances with a bunch of vultures when they sing about eating everybody. He\'s portrayed as so stupid he basically becomes an asshole but it\'s okay because he\'s too stupid to realize he\'s being an asshole.\r\n\r\nAlso Therman Merman in Bad Santa 2. In the original, Therman was naive and innocent but also shy, quiet, and reserved, only really being talkative when he was talking about Santa and Christmas with Willie but otherwise he kept to hismelf. In the sequel, they keep the naive and innocent part but make him less shy and make him a really giggly, happy manchild who always wants to make friends. In other words, they turned him into Buddy from Elf, except with a much deeper voice, which honestly made him really, really creepy.\r\n\r\nSame thing happened with Marcus. He went from being the straight man to Willie who wanted him to get his shit together that was also horny and the butt of short jokes to a character whose sole purpose in the movie is to either be horny or be the butt of short jokes. There is a thing about there being tension between him and Willie considering he, y\'know, tried to kill Willie last time but it\'s only mentioned a few times and it\'s a pretty damn underdeveloped plot point, mostly his role has been reduced to being made fun of for being short and getting horny.','Last Christmas',6,21,'2019-04-03 19:03:19'),('b95wgq','‘The New Mutants’ Promoted At CinemaCon, Indicating Theatrical Release','','The New Mutants',262,52,'2019-04-03 20:24:47'),('b97nf8','I love how people have been complaining about DC being too Dark for a couple of years now','And asking them to lighten up and have “FUN”, but then their lightest and most “FUN” venture, Shazam, which opens in a day, is going to be their lowest grossing film in over 7 years and one of the lowest grossing films of this era of live action superhero films and their probably their Darkest Venture yet, Joker, has currently been blowing up on social media and has completely eclipsed Shazam in terms of anticipation and prerelease hype.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder what this says about most people, cause the evidence seems to point that majority are hypocrites and just say what others say to feel among.

The ensemble cast is the stuff of cinephile wet dreams, and the subject matter of gangster life and crime is familiar territory for Scorsese, who made some of the greatest movies of all time in said genre. In the 1980s or 1990s, on paper this would definitely be the type of project to throw money at, but in 2019, it\'s by far the biggest risk of being a flop.\r\n\r\nDe Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel, Scorsese. These are genre defining legends of cinema no doubt, but none of these have anywhere near the box office pull in 2019 to justify such a huge amount of money spent on one project. You\'d have to go back to the 90s to find the last Scorsese project without DiCaprio to do business at the box office. De Niro and Pacino have spent their latter years in substandard projects and have generally lost the drawing power they had back in their heyday. Pesci has been retired for years, and Keitel was never a \'movie star\' to begin with.\r\n$200 Million for a non-franchise Scorsese mob movie in 2019 is ridiculous. Actually, from a financial standpoint utterly absurd. In this post-Avengers era, budgets of $150 Million and over are normally reserved for franchise movies, properties with a significantly built in fan base and Christopher Nolan. That\'s because the average movie goer nowadays is more drawn to familiar family friendly IPs than R-Rated dramas (Nolan being an exception). The rare stars who can open movies without IPs (like The Rock or Leonardo DiCaprio) aren\'t involved in this project. So basically, on paper, nothing about this project can guarantee financial success at the global box office. Word of mouth alone isn\'t a guarantee, or Denis Villeneuve\'s Blade Runner would have returned a profit (and it had a built-in fanbase and cost less to make).\r\n\r\nScorsese is my favorite director and next to OUATIH this is my most anticipated movie of 2019. Hopefully it makes bank because that would inspire studios to bankroll more ambitious projects. However, one can\'t help but fear the spectre of a flop hanging over this project. Either way, this movie could be a defining moment in mainstream cinema. On one hand it could somehow be a huge success (It would need an estimated $500 Million to break even), and encourage major studios to spend more money on ambitious projects besides spinoffs/reboots/franchises (not badmouthing them, just stating how it is). On the other hand, it could be a flop that could scare big studios of big budget prestige dramas for a long time and serve as a cautionary tale. Or maybe, it could turn out like the aforementioned Blade Runner and do good business, but not good enough business and encourage studios to be a bit stricter with passion project budgets.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, I look forward to seeing the final product and keep my fingers crossed for the success of this movie','After',2631,797,'2019-04-04 18:29:29'),('b9je7h','STX Nabs Animated Pic \'Playmobil: The Movie\' for U.S. Release','','Playmobil: The Movie',7,3,'2019-04-04 18:35:52'),('b9jyv3','Is it really worth going to IMAX movies anymore?','Today I saw Shazam in 2D IMAX, and there was no effect.

I have a lot of thoughts on this movie that I’ve wanted to put onto paper for some time now, so that is what this is. This is all my interpretation so it is okay to completely disagree with me on some of the things I say. This also contains spoilers for the movie as I go over the entire plot. Here’s my analysis of Taxi Driver:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nTravis Bickle, the movie’s protagonist, lives in New York City, one of the most populated cities in the world, yet he feels isolated and lonely. He is surrounded by people everywhere he goes, but fails to maintain a connection with any of them.\r\n\r\nTravis works as a taxi driver and spends his time driving through the city. He sees the people of New York, he sees people in groups, in couples. Everyone he notices, or chooses to notice, is accompanied by friends or their partner. Travis takes this all in while he is isolated and alone in his taxi cab. There is a phrase that goes “It is better to be alone than feel lonely in a room full of people”. This is applicable to Travis’s situation as the constant sight of people in relationships feeds to his own loneliness.\r\n\r\nTravis writes in his diary: “I don’t believe one should devote his life to morbid self-attention”. Travis refuses to evaluate himself. He is afraid of the soul-crushing depression that might follow if he looks at and analyzes his own life and persona.\r\n\r\nWe see Travis try and hit on a cashier at a movie theatre. His attempt is met with absolute rejection. We can tell that this is nothing new to Travis. Rejection is something that Travis has dealt with for a long time now. He desperately tries to connect with the people around him but is met with constant rejection, and so he naturally starts to resent what he can’t be apart of. He starts to view everyone as scum and trash. It’s the only way he can cope with his alienation. To view himself as superior in some way. \r\n\r\nTravis continues to drive around the city, slowly building a hatred toward everyone he sees. Travis’s long history of rejection has caused him to build an exterior shell around him. We see this when Travis gets coffee with his cab buddies. The other cabbies make attempts to try and talk to Travis but Travis is cold and distant. If he doesn’t open up to anyone, than he can’t be hurt by anyone. This logic only accelerates Travis’s loneliness. He is now isolating himself by choice. \r\n\r\nWe see Travis develop a crush on someone he spots on the street. This is his weakness. He convinces himself that this girl isn’t like the other scum and that he can be vulnerable around her. Travis asks her out on a date and she says yes. They go out for coffee and Travis feels himself forming a connection with someone for the first time in a long time. For their second date, Travis takes her to a risque movie, something Travis thinks is socially acceptable. She is incredibly insulted and he ends up scaring her away. This crushes Travis. He opened himself up and is left abandoned at the end of it all. He tries to call her to apologize and is met with utter and absolute rejection. She wants nothing to do with him. This sets Travis over the edge. He can’t cope with the rejection, the loneliness, and it quickly turns to more resentment and hatred toward everyone around him. He sees himself as completely alone and alienated. \r\n\r\nAs a masked cry for help, Travis seeks counseling from one of his cab buddies. But when he opens his mouth to explain his dilemma, he finds that he can’t articulate his thoughts. Because of this, Travis’s cab buddy misinterprets his problem, preventing him from helping Travis. Travis is still trapped inside of his head. With no outlet and no one to bounce his thoughts off of, he can only have an echo chamber of increasingly resentful thoughts that lead him down a path to madness. Travis’s thoughts of hatred and disgust toward the people around him start to turn violent. This scares Travis. He doesn’t know where the path he is headed down is taking him.\r\n\r\nTravis meets a child prostitute attempting to escape from her pimp. Travis watches as the pimp takes the prostitute back under his wing. Finally, Travis finds something purposeful in his life that he must do. He needs to free the child prostitute. This is the perfect way for Travis to release his increasingly violent thoughts on the scum of the city. Travis’s goal has been put into motion. He start to purchase weapons. He starts to workout. But as he spends more time alone, his violent ideas pivot. He turns them to the bigger picture. His hatred for the general public. The society that has rejected him. That outcasted him. But how can he damage them the most? Senator Palantine. A rising star in the community. If he were to take him out, surely it would crush everyone. Perfect. Travis sets out to assassinate the Senator at his next rally but his plan is quickly shut down by the secret service. So Travis retracts back to the original plan and sets out to take out the pimp. Travis shows up at the pimp’s hotel. And like the madman he has turned into, he murders the pimp as well as two of his associates, ultimately freeing the child prostitute. His mission is done. He completed his goal, leaving him once again with no purpose. Travis, left with nothing else to live for, tries to commit suicide right there on the spot, but he’s out of ammo.\r\n\r\nTravis is hailed as a hero by the general public for freeing a child prostitute. No one understands or realizes what Travis is going through or what led him down the path to commit the murders. And so he slinks back into his depressive state and continues to ride his taxi around the city, trying to repress his feelings as he slowly goes down the path of insanity all over again.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite movie of all time. It is more rewatchable for me than any other movie because instead of focusing on plot, it focuses more on showcasing a human emotion that we can all relate to: Loneliness. And the danger of it. \r\n\r\nThe first time I saw this movie, I really sympathized with Travis for the first half of the movie. But then in the second half, he betrayed me. I started questioning his actions and where they were ultimately taking him. The Travis in the latter half of the movie was unrecognizable to the one I connected with at the beginning. But then I realized that this movie is supposed to act as a cautionary tale. This is what can happen if you choose to submerge yourself in the feeling of loneliness. It shows the danger of romanticizing loneliness and immersing yourself in it. And this is made no more obvious than in the soundtrack. The soundtrack starts out smooth and therapeutic. Almost hypnotic. It confuses Travis’s feeling of loneliness with a nicer feeling of bliss. But then, before you know that you’re too far deep into the trap, the music jolts and switches suddenly to violent clashes, revealing the monster that has silently been growing inside of Travis.\r\n\r\nI think loneliness is caused by reoccurring rejection. But I also think that after a certain point, it becomes self-inflicted. Even though the rejection is painful, you have to keep trying or you’ll be stuck in the feeling of loneliness.','Escape Room',12,3,'2019-04-05 03:43:08'),('b9otuk','‘Hellboy’ Receives Rare R 18+ Rating in Australia for Strong Bloody Violence and Gore','','Hellboy',3710,393,'2019-04-05 05:04:47'),('b9qh6z','New Poster for ‘Ma’','','Ma',603,153,'2019-04-05 08:16:58'),('b9rcdj','[Spoilers] My biggest issue with Glass','The hoard was locked in a room with flashing lights that would trigger him to switch personalities.

I love how Angel Eyes just sits down with the man he’s being paid to kill and starts eating without saying a word and shows zero empathy throughout the whole scene. Lee Van Cleef makes every line spoken by Angel Eyes in this scene sound so badass. The guy is basically begging for Angel Eyes not to kill him the whole time and all he does is smirk, and then after gunning down the man he shoots and kills his young son like it’s nothing. It was like some Terminator shit. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother favorite of mine is [The Massacre of the McBain Family ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QqTfBysL0wE) from Once Upon a Time in the West. Frank and his boys gun down a whole innocent family like it’s nothing. The way Henry Fonda says “Now that you’ve called me by name” after one his his men asks him what they should do with the boy was straight up chilling. And the thing that puts the icing on the evil cake is later you find out that Frank wasn’t even told to kill the family, just scare them off the land. Frank took it upon himself to murder him because he enjoys it.

A few they mentioned are:\r\n\r\n\\- Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa (Dan actual wonders how much was written for Waltz and I remember reading before that Tim Roth was meant to be cast in that role to start with but then couldn\'t do it, I could be wrong though)\r\n\r\n\\- Wesley Snipes as Blade\r\n\r\n\\- RDJ as Iron Man\r\n\r\n\\- Multiple X-Men characters (Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Kelsey Grammer, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Evan Peters, All the new X-Men basically except for J-Law)\r\n\r\n\\- Vin Diesel in the Fast series (in nothing else though, although I would argue that the Riddick series was pretty good casting)\r\n\r\n\\- The LOTR series as a whole but specifically Sean Bean as Borimir (Arguement is that Borimir in the books seemed like an asshole and a douche that you don\'t care about and most people just wanted to get past his storyline and get to Faramir but Bean brought such a great performance that he made the character better. Plus the meme he launched is OG)\r\n\r\n\\- Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther/T\'challa and the MCU in general has done a pretty great job casting (mentioned is how Dr Strange was the obvious casting choice but sometimes obvious is best. Commented on how Ruffalo was a great recast to the Hulk from Norton.)\r\n\r\n\\- The weirdness of Batman casting from Keaton to Kilmer to Clooney all being strange choices with Keaton being a favorite afterwards but how it was shit on at the time.\r\n\r\n\\- The cast of Eighth Grade.\r\n\r\n\\- The cast of Jurassic Park (even the smaller roles being cast perfectly)\r\n\r\n\\- Ensable casts mentioned: Glengarry Glen Ross, Bridesmaids, This is Spinal Tap, Bachelorette (2012), Goodfellas\r\n\r\n\\- TV ensables: Parks and Rec, The Wire, Game of Thrones (specifically Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell) , Breaking Bad (highlighting Bob Odenkirk and Jonathon Banks)\r\n\r\nThey go on to talk about weird casting choices they liked, mentioning Heath Ledger as The Joker and Liam Neeson taking an action star turn.\r\n\r\nI wonder is there anything you can think of that they missed in either categories (great casting choices or weird ones that you loved) or maybe some terrible choices made in casting. \r\n\r\nA few I will mention would be Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, JK Simmons as J.

Not the worst movie ever made, but it\'s about on par with those old cheesey sci fi channel monster movies. If Stanley Tucci wasn\'t in this, it would be buried deep in the Netflix library, never to be seen or heard by anyone, ever.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nLet\'s get the obvious out of the way - **The Silence** is a super obvious ripoff of **A** **Quiet Place**. Or maybe vice versa, and **A Quiet Place** just got to production first. I don\'t know which movie was written first or whatever, but the similarities are so obvious that I find it almost impossible to believe that one script writer wasn\'t copying the other. Like **A Quiet Place**, **The Silence**:\r\n\r\n\\- Is about blind monsters who eat people and rely entirely on hearing, taking over the earth.\r\n\r\n\\- Is about a family with a deaf daughter. And because of the deaf daughter, the whole family knows sign language, which gives them a survival advantage in this new world.\r\n\r\n\\- Has the family move to a quiet cabin in the middle of the woods.\r\n\r\n\\- Has a family member sacrifice his/herself by screaming to alert the monsters.\r\n\r\n\\- Has the family carefully maneuvering through a store in a picturesque small American town.\r\n\r\n\\- Has scenes where tension is based around trying to keep a baby quiet.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nBut unlike **A Quiet Place**, **The Silence** is really, really, really, stupid. Let\'s see if I can remember all the idiocy:\r\n\r\n\\- Characters never remember that they can just pick something up and throw it somewhere else to distract the monsters. At one point, two characters are trapped in a building with the monsters, so one picks up a mop, passes it to the other, he lights the mop on fire, and then holds it up to a sprinkler system. They could have done all that *or* they could have picked up a random thing and throw in across the room and it would have had the same impact.\r\n\r\n\\- In the beginning of the movie, a bunch of high schoolers (maybe a dozen) mock a girl for being deaf. Because that is something that happens these days.\r\n\r\n\\- In the most obvious display of terrible writing, horrible things keep happening to the family which have nothing to do with the monsters. They get into a car accident because deer run across the road. A bunch of them nearly get killed because a rattle snake happened to pop into the tunnel they were using. The writers were so lazy that they had to contrive random dangers in the deadly region of upstate New York to get the family to move the plot along.\r\n\r\n\\- Before any of the family members see a single monster in person, and while there are none around, one family member gets trapped and decides to sacrifice his life in, like, thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n\\- Stanley Tucci decided to open a rusty gate with bells attached to it which could literally kill him with the slightest false move, rather than just crawl through the tunnel he already crawled through once before.\r\n\r\n\\- The movie has blatantly post-edited voice overs in the beginning and end to explain the plot and character motivations to the audience. The VO is completely absent from the middle 90% of the movie.\r\n\r\n\\- The wife is utterly useless and just gets beaten up the whole movie. I literally can\'t remember a single thing she accomplished.\r\n\r\n\\- In the last third of the movie, the bad guys are a cult of religious fanatics who cut out their own tongues, try to get the family to join them, and eventually try to kidnap the family\'s daughter because she\'s *fertile*. All of this happens, like, *one week* after the monsters arrive. In one week, maybe ten people become self-mutilating psycho-cult members. Also, cutting out a person\'s tongue doesn\'t stop them from making noise, not unless you take out the vocal cords too.\r\n\r\n\\- The movie glosses over how this family walked from upstate New York to the *Arctic Circle* like it\'s no big deal.\r\n\r\n\\- The movie ends with a monologue about evolution and adaption which has nothing to do with anything at all.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nBasically, the movie is very, very bad.

Ones by vangogh the other by henri fantin latour. Realism vs expressionism. Be honest with me which one is your eye immediately drawn to? For most people its the left one. I care nothing about the right one i dont even give it a glance. But look at the differences. Now both these artists are extremely talented and know what theyre doing and i could never come close. \r\n\r\n\r\nVangoghs is messy its saturated we have brush strokes paint where it shouldnt be the flowers are weirdly shaped the light seems to just be there and eminating and its unrealistically contrasted. But i cant stop looking at it. \r\n\r\nHenrys is different. In a time of thick acrlyics he has 0 brush strokes. His highlights are thought out (the reds are way brighter in person) he did cool water effects with the vase. His lighting is thought out as well as his shadows and reflections. Yet its uninteresting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo lets talk about movies\r\n\r\n\r\nI just recently watched The Highwaymen and this movie is so irritating because it isnt a bad movie. Look at the cast! Its studded with really great actors i love most of them over half were in the walking dead or on other great shows. Theyre all talented actors hut jot the type to take over a script like a Clooney. The movie did everything right. It has good shots but theyre just correct. It has great acting but the characters are bland and uninteresting. The story drives along it doesnt get slow but it never gets interesting its very normal. This movie becomes the embodiement of the second painting. \r\n\r\nIt has all the correct pieces but its missing soul. Its missing love. Its missing passion. This movie was written by a committee afraid of twitter. It takes 0 risk. It has all the right notes but its not a song. Even the soundtrack is just a basic what im calling “millenial guitar” the same kind of guitar you hear in commercials. It just irritates me how passable it is. Its so easy to completely overlook it like henrys painting. Im not saying one style is better than the other but we’re getting so many movies that are technically perfect but lack anything interesting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this isnt the only one how many movies are released like this and just fall flat? They have an interesting concept, a great crew and great cast and it just isnt anything.

Why? Because we need more discussion about the movie US and we need to explore why there is so little discussion about the movie US.  I realize that what I am about to say is going to be unsettling, but I believe it will make sense.\r\n\r\nWhat we all agree on about US:\r\n\r\nThe world is flawed. There is no explanation of the infrastructure that supports the existence of the subterranean duplicates. \r\n\r\nNo plausible explanation about the psychic connection that makes them mimic actions of the surface dwellers.\r\n\r\nSo... we just go with it the way we go with dragons in Game of Thrones: for the fun in it. We forcibly suspend our disbelief.\r\n\r\nWe all agree the movie is a single feature length Twilight Zone episode — I am not revealing the twist but someone in the comments might.\r\n\r\nSo... how is this movie richer than a Twilight Zone episode?\r\n\r\nWell, obviously in it’s juxtaposition of race. \r\n\r\nWe have a black family and a white family.\r\n\r\nThe white family is presented as kind of shallow — interested in medicating their lives with drugs and alcohol. Electronic devices.\r\n\r\nThe black family are rendered whole: loving, complicated, beautiful.\r\n\r\nSo, could this be the fun? This caricature of the white family? \r\n\r\nPlease note that this white family are so shallow, unthinking, superficial, and underprepared that they have zero defense against their doppelgängers. Could some of the entertainment value in this film lie in the simple pleasure of watching subhuman people (whites) killed by their literal subterranean counterparts (even more subhuman whites)?\r\n\r\nThere is an interlude in this film where the black family murders all of the white doppelgängers one after the other. This is of course profoundly entertaining. Right?\r\n\r\nCould some of the pleasure of this movie lie in the supremacy of the black family as they outwit their own doppelgängers time and time again? They are so smart and powerful that they not only defeat their doppelgängers but they master all opposition placed in front of them.\r\n\r\nThey are in fact, at the end of the movie, the dominant species of human being (there being two species now in this world, subterranean and surface dweller).\r\n\r\nSo, clearly this is part of the satisfying racial conversation that few people feel comfortable approaching.\r\n\r\nPeele demands that we approach it with the juxtaposition The Beach Boys with NWA.\r\n\r\nObviously the movie offers us an implausible foundation— a world that cannot exist — and a tawdry and relatively predictable twist at the end.\r\n\r\nSo, Peele being the genius that he is, his attention is not on those filmic aspects — it is on the racial elements here. \r\n\r\nThe success of one family versus the complete failure of the other.\r\n\r\nLet’s converse.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\n\r\nUS offers us a depiction of humanity where whites are clueless easily murdered losers while blacks are complicated superheroes.','Us',0,54,'2019-04-11 14:29:53'),('bc3lrj','Why M.

I can’t remember this movie’s name','So I found this movie on Netflix a few years back, but it’s not on there any longer, and I’m having troubles finding it. \r\n\r\nIt’s a quiet anime movie with beautiful scenery, so here’s my best attempt at describing it:\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with the princess being locked in her room. She’s been sneaking out and doing other things. \r\nThe film brings up that there is a quest going on, where her suitors are trying to go and impress her, because no one is returning. \r\nOne day, she is fed up and escapes the kingdom successfully. Once she leaves, she finds a barren desert with an almost abandoned castle and small village. \r\nIn the castle, she finds a magic old forgotten king. He sees her as a threat, and puts her in a tall inescapable room. \r\nFor about ~15 mins we see her pondering her thoughts in this room with many failed escapes. But, she eventually makes it out. When she gets away, she discovers the village near the castle. \r\nThe villagers explain that for many years, the village has experienced a drought. The king had done some sort of magic to make the area a barren land. He promised to give the people a magic stone that when placed in a pot of water, it would multiply and overflow forever, creating an infinite water supply. However, they had to do something for him. They held up there end, but he never gave them the stone. \r\nThe girl goes back to the castle to find this said stone, and eventually does. The king finds her, and gets confused. \r\nShe confronts him about the ordeal, but he thought he had given it to them. \r\nThe movie ends with the desert turning into a beautiful grassland with lots of water. \r\n\r\nI really hope you guys can help find out what this movie is called. I’ve done digging, but to no results.

I get the intention to be allagorical, but just practicality and logically, if dying Grandpa was suddenly reincarnated into a healthy, new body, you would not respond to that miracle with, \'Cool! Now get to work on that firewood! Chop chop! Don\'t interact with us anymore, cos now we\'re better than you!\'\r\n\r\nSo the obvious answer that satisfies all the metaphors is, \'they got put into black bodies so the are now being treated as white people typically treat black people,\' but Grandma and Grandpa chose black bodies (via the bingo voting)?? They chose to put themselves into physical bodies that would result in them being treated worse, socially, by their own white family, and that\'s what doesn\'t make sense. If the purpose of kidnapping black people was to put white brains into \'bigger, better, faster\' bodies, as they claim, then why does that contract also seem to come with the fineprint of, \'oh, but after we reincarnate you, you\'ll become a house slave. Agreed? Cool.\' \r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nAnd this obviously wasn\'t the same fate of the reincarnated husband. He got to chill at the party, drink martinis, wearing fancy clothes, and live the high life as he was living before. So unless Grandma and Grandpa were slave-like to the family beforehand, these new roles as servants appears to be something they would have had to consciously agreed to/assumed would happen prior to choosing their new bodies.\r\n\r\nObviously their minds are torn, and part of their original selves are trying to fight back and escape, but it\'s the family\'s treatment of their own elders that doesn\'t make sense. I think we needed more info on the grandparents to really get their motivations for chosing black bodies, besides it being \'fashionable\'. Are Grandma and Grandpa ok with living a life of servitude if they get to live forever? Did they consciously agree prior to brain surgery to be treated that way after being placed into black bodies?','After',0,19,'2019-04-13 11:17:25'),('bcrpsf','Blade (1998) and Hellboy (2004) are very similar movies.','I recently watched Blade for the first time and noticed how similar it felt to Hellboy (GDT one).

Its camera of choice is quite possibly the most talked-about aspect of the film, and it no doubts spawned numerous “feature films shot with a smartphone” novelty list articles. What these websites fail to mention was that the 2018 low-budget film directed by Steven Soderbergh is an incredibly effective thriller with scathing social commentaries.\r\n\r\nI want to say *Unsane* is a film that takes the stalker situation to its logical extreme, but I can not. Women facing unsolicited advances is not a fantastical scenario; it is something that happens to them every day. And to our society’s shame, some of these women have met worse ends than Sawyer Valentini. *Unsane* plays the game of “Is she? Isn’t she?” and toys with the possibility of Sawyer conjuring up the unrelenting suitor in her mind, but not for long. Sawyer is soon proved to be justified in her paranoia, spoiler alert, by the way. In a world where the word “crazy” is frequently thrown (as a form of dismissal) at women who fail to act according to men’s expected emotional states, by cutting the trope short, *Unsane* gives voice to the “crazy woman”.

His holy trinity of Starship Troopers, Total Recall and RoboCop are absolutely favorites of mine. What makes them distinct from other similar films is that on the surface they’re simply well-made action movies, but deeper down they’re smartly written social commentary. Starship Troopers was an in-universe propaganda film that commentated on the dangers of a fascist government and RoboCop warned of the dangers of capitalism and big business growing too far. Ready Player One was perfect for that distinction. On the surface, RPO could simply be a fun action romp with pop culture references smeared across the screen. But deeper down, RPO could have really biting commentary on how popular culture has replaced actual culture in this modern age, with new Avengers or Star Wars or Jurassic Park movies making billions and how rereleases of classic game consoles like the NES and Genesis sell like Hotcakes with issues of Playboy attached. The release of Avengers: Endgame and the 8th season of Game of Thrones are practically national events. Funko Pop figures adorn the shelves and walls like religious artifacts. The global love of this commercialized culture is a good mine for potential for a film maker like Paul Verhoeven.

Night Shyamalan’s “Glass” or “How Not to Write a Twist” *SPOILERS*','*Glass* is the follow up film that ties M. Night Shyamalan’s superhero film *Unbreakable* with his supernatural thriller *Split*, and deals with superhuman vigilante David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and malignant psychopathic Kevin Wendell Crumb aka “The Horde” being captured and brought to an institution for the criminally insane by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) under the auspices of her study on people with the delusion of being superheroes. Also locked up in this hospital is evil master mind Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), and the film spends much of its two hour plus running time with Dr. Staple trying to convince these three that they aren’t special, but being the fact that David’s power are empirically easy to prove exists this comes across as utter bullshit…unless of course Dr. Staple has some secret agenda.\r\n\r\nThe Stupidity that is “Glass”   *Spoilers*\r\n\r\n* David is locked in a cell that can be pumped full of water – his one weakness – but if Staple is trying to prove David is normal putting him in a “kryptonite” cell isn’t a smart move, because if he was just an average dude a regular cell would hold him just fine.\r\n\r\n* Dr. Staple has a group therapy session with our three leads, where she tries to chip away at the belief they are superhuman – pointing out that “The Beast” could have bent bars because they were old and weak, and survived a shotgun blast for the same reason – but she never gets around to explaining away how David is virtually unbreakable and super strong.\r\n\r\n* Elijah is given pretty much free reign in this psyche ward due to the fact that they apparently only keep one guard on duty at a time, and if one is late showing up for work the other one fucks off anyway.\r\n\r\n* Video footage is only checked on when it’s helpful to the plot, and Elijah is able to delete all his wanderings without anyone noticing jumps in time code.  He’s apparently just that good or everyone else is just that bad at their jobs.\r\n\r\n* Dr. Staple plans to use a laser surgery on Elijah’s brain to lobotomize him, but unbeknownst to her on one of his nightly forays he’d stolen the lenses out of the laser, and thus after the surgery is “performed” he is returned to his room unchanged.  Question:  How in the fuck can you perform a lobotomy with a broken laser and not notice?  Is there some kind of magical lasers that can access the brain without actually cutting through flesh?  Or is Dr. Staple just an idiot for not seeing that her operation is actually happening?\r\n\r\n* Elijah informs David of their plans to attack and destroy a chemical company, but David actually is starting to wonder of Dr. Staple is right, and his powers are all in his mind, which once again this is ridiculous because he has quantifiable super powers.\r\n\r\n* Elijah and The Beast are able to walk through hospital checkpoints simply because they have a stolen key card, and somehow none of the guards recognize two of the most notorious killers to ever walk the streets of this fair city.\r\n\r\n* It’s revealed that Dr. Staple works for a clandestine society that has been covering up the existence of super humans for centuries, and if she could convince these three that they aren’t special they’d be left alone, but if she fails they will be executed. This is apparently to protect humanity from the fights that would stem from superheroes and supervillains popping up, and by god there has to be a more efficient way of handling this situation.\r\n\r\n* Staples primary mission is to keep the world in the dark about people with super powers, yet she installs dozens of extra cameras to keep an eye on the ever slippery Elijah, which just plays into his hands as he was able to hack the system and stream the superhero fight to an offsite server, but if your goal is secrecy maybe have less cameras and more guards on hand – ones who work for the secret society and not the idiots we see employed by this hospital.\r\n\r\nIt’s clear that M. Night Shyamalan had this big idea about superhero mythology - this idea does have merit and could have led to an interesting movie - but the moronic actions and statements by Dr. Staple made it pretty obvious early on that she must have some secret agenda, because her “People with delusions” theory wouldn’t hold up for ten seconds when put to David Dunn, who could just ask an orderly to stab in the leg with a pen to prove he’s unbreakable.  The amount of hoop jumping Shyamalan had to write into this script to make this twist work is simply inexcusable, and is basically an example of a screenwriter trying to ram a round peg in a square hole.','Glass',45,31,'2019-04-17 19:45:54'),('bef88v','Henry Winkler randomly landed the iconic role as Coach in \'The Waterboy\' after calling Adam Sandler to thank him for mentioning him in The Chanukah Song.','','After',15146,473,'2019-04-17 20:33:52'),('begozu','Christmas themed horror/comedy movie idea I had (feedback appreciated)','So the plot is that Santa Claus has an accident with a rocket powered reindeer less sleigh, and then Mrs. Claus and the elves rebuild/revive him as a cyborg.

La Llorona, also known as the Weeping Woman, is a female ghost in Latin American folklore who lost her children and causes misfortune to those nearby. As she searches for them, she takes other lost children, making them her own.

Jackson) fakes his death complete with grave and grave stone. On the grave stone, the filmmakers inserted an easter egg that is a nod to arguably Samuel L. Jackson’s most famous role. In Pulp Fiction, SLJ plays Jules Winnfield who is a bad motherfucker. A major plot device is Jule’s use of a bible quote right before he killed someone because he thought it was a “cold-blooded thing” to say to someone you’re about to kill. It is this quote plus what Jule’s feels is divine intervention that leads to Jule’s “salvation”. Jule’s also alluded to the fact that he “reads” the Bible and he then quotes the verse. However, the verse he quotes (Ezekiel 25:17) isn’t real. Meaning, it doesn’t exist in our bible, but it does exist in the bible in both the world of Pulp-Fiction and... the MCU.  They specifically reference this verse on Fury’s grave stone. So, I posit that Pulp Fiction’s universe and The MCU are the same universe.

While taking a few liberties with some inconsequential band facts, the movie itself is noteworthy for how perfectly they captured the look, feel, and style of the \'80s band scene.\r\n\r\nMost movies that try to capture the \'80s fall into the campy Flock of Seagulls/bright neon/leg warmers clichè.\r\nThe Dirt skips the campy pop culture entirely and captures the cocaine fueled grit of the era. The debauchery and hedonism that we lived with reckless abandon back then was the soul of the movie, and not played for nostalgia laughs. \r\n\r\nThe costuming was brilliant. Most movies trying to recreate the style of the \'80s go over the top and look cartoony and ridiculous. The Dirt\'s costumers got everything right. You can actually accurately follow and define \'83 era Crue vs \'87 era Crue by their clothing in the movie. Same with hair and makeup. Watching the sometimes subtle/sometimes not transitions of Tommy Lee and Nikki Sixx\'s hair throughout the movie is an accurate guide for where in the timeline you are watching.\r\n\r\nMostly, the look and feel of the off stage party life scenes were the resonating feature. If you boiled life down to tits, cocaine, and Jack Daniels and filled in all the remaining gaps with debauchery and good times, you\'ve nailed it. And this movie does it.\r\n\r\nAnd also inbetween the raucous fun there\'s actually some poignant stories of family, brotherhood, emotional pain, and tragic loss that are handled in imperfect and very human ways.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re a millennial and want to know what the \'80s *really* were like, this is the movie for you. (Just be warned...you may never look your mom in the eye again once you see what she was up to back then.)\r\n\r\nAvailable now on Netflix','The Dirt',0,7,'2019-04-19 05:17:16'),('bf08k5','Filmmaker Driven Superhero Movies','This is something I\'ve been meaning to post for awhile and I feel like now is the perfect time considering Avengers Endgame is almost here, the behind the scenes drama about the Hellboy shoot getting out, the amazing Joker trailer from a couple weeks ago, etc. \r\n\r\nLike a lot of people, I love good comic book movies and I used to love the MCU as a whole a few years ago, but as I\'ve gotten older my opinions on the MCU have changed. I still like/love some of their films like the original Iron Man, the first Thor, and Guardians 1, but I\'ve also been really disappointed by their last few films like Guardians 2, Spider-Man Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok, etc and one of the big reasons why is because the Marvel formula is getting stale IMHO. Some people jokingly call the MCU the greatest/most expensive TV show being produced right now with Kevin Feige as the showrunner and they kind of have a point. It feels kind of like a TV show where the producers and in house writers have far more creative say than the directors. And because we have an MCU that\'s so producer driven and concerned with how all the movies connect, that can limit creativity. A prime example of this is Edgar Wright\'s scrapped Ant-Man film. Many were excited that the director of Shaun Of The Dead and Scott Pilgrim would be directing a superhero movie (Myself included), but because Wright\'s vision and style didn\'t fit into the larger MCU, he left.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other studios that have made movies based on Marvel/DC properties have allowed their superhero movies to be more filmmaker driven and for the directors to put their fingerprints on the movies. Look at Christopher Nolan\'s Dark Knight Trilogy, Sam Raimi\'s Spider-Man films (Even Spider-Man 3, with it\'s forced inclusions of Venom and Gwen Stacy, still fills like a Raimi film), Tim Miller\'s original Deadpool, Guillermo Del Toro\'s Hellboy films, James Mangold\'s Logan, Patty Jenkins\'s Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder\'s Watchmen, Man Of Steel, and Batman V Superman (Love or hate those films, those were HIS films), etc (And if that trailer is any indication, Todd Phillips\'s Joker). They\'re able to do this because they don\'t make hugely interconnected franchises like the MCU. The Fox X-Men films (Which will be ending soon sadly) don\'t care that much about the overall continuity and just focus on the movie they\'re making and with DC, they\'re now focusing on just stand alone solo films.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s not just about the MCU formula. We also have had some big instances where studio meddling has ruined superhero films. Prime examples of this include\r\n\r\nWB going over budget on Green Lantern and kicking Martin Campbell out of the editing room, firing the original directors of Jonah Hex and instead cobbling together a horrible mess of a film, having a trailer company edit Suicide Squad without David Ayer, and having Joss Whedon reshoot large portions of Zack Snyder\'s Justice League.\r\n\r\nLionsgate and the producers of Hellboy (2019) screwing over Neil Marshall by firing the cinematographer and taking the film away from him.\r\n\r\nMarvel forcing Jon Favreau all that unnecessary Avengers set up in Iron Man 2.\r\n\r\nSony forcing Marc Webb to put in all that Sinister Six set up and sub plots in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox micro managing Gavin Hood during the production of X-Men Origins Wolverine and ruining Josh Trank\'s original cut of Fantastic Four (2015).\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I personally believe that we need more filmmaker driven CBM for the genre to continue going for years to come.

Sadly, beyond the first few scenes, the entire construct fell completely flat. Aside from the acting, which was very good, the movie seemed poorly written, poorly edited, and in many instances derivative in very obvious ways (elements lifted almost directly from “The Sixth Sense” and especially “The Blair Witch Project”). I seriously wonder why Universal Studio executives didn’t ask Jordan Peele to at least rewrite scenes to make certain parts of this somewhat comprehensible. Why make a seemingly important biblical reference if you’re never going to explain it? (I don’t carry my copy of the Old Testament with me to the movies, and other moviegoers sure don’t like you whipping out your cellphone to look it up). Why have dozens of rabbits at first caged, then hopping around freely and then never adequately give a hint at their significance? Why would a woman never once tell her husband of many years that at one time she was struck catatonic as a child, and then agree to go back to the exact place it happened and not be asked about the reasons for her extreme reluctance? What did ‘Hands Across America’ have anything to do at all with the overall plot except that it took place in the moment of time that the girl was traumatized?

Like most movies, it does take creative license. The real experiment ended before violence could take place. While I sided with Karo throughout the movie, I could understand the appeal of the organization especially to Tim.

In 1967, when the original experiment took place, there were no such safety measures and that\'s how the situation arose in the first place. I assume it takes place in 2008 because of the dates on the signs in Rainer\'s and Anke\'s house. Is there no such system in Germany? 2) The movie ends with Mr. Wenger going to jail for allowing this whole thing to happen. How come Principal Kohlhage doesn\'t go to jail? There is this brief moment where Rainer is talking to her, and she tells him that Jen\'s father was proud of the profound transition Jen had gone through because of The Wave. She concludes it by saying something along the lines of (and I\'m basing this off the English subtitles since I\'m in German I) You have my full support\"\" for the experiment. She - like Rainer - didn\'t believe the experiment could go so out of hand.

The idea of bringing together David Dunn, Mr. Glass and The Beast was an epic cross over in my eyes. At points it was anticlimactic but overall I enjoyed the film, until the ending. The way the three main characters were killed off it seemed like something was missing. And so here\'s how I feel like the ending should have gone (and this is just my personal preference not trying to twist Shyamalan\'s style); \r\n\r\nCasey should have been shot — not fatally — instead of Kevin. Yes it probably was an expert marksmen aiming at Kevin but his miss could have been dismissed as a mistake. The two of them escape. \r\n\r\nDavid Dunn can still die. IIRC in the movie Joseph didn\'t see them drowning Dunn. But I would like to see Joseph fighting to get to his dad. \r\n\r\nThe CCTV footage that Mr Glass sent to Joseph, mama Glass and Casey is still released to the public. Kevin Crumb is known as a highly dangerous individual suffering from D.I.D that escaped from a psychiatric institution and may have a hostage. \r\n\r\nSomewhere Casey is patched up but she insists on going to the hospital or talking to Kevin, Patricia will have none of that.\r\n\r\n And although I think Shyalaman intended Unbreakable/Split/Glass to be a trilogy, I feel that Kevin had more of a story to tell. With coming to terms with his past and being able to confide in Casey — who\'s probably the first friend he\'s had in who knows how long. \r\n\r\nIf the ending did go like that and another movie was made, it\'d be cool if it could center on Kevin going through the journey of trying to spend more time in the light and keeping his other identities in check.','Glass',0,12,'2019-04-20 00:32:52'),('bf8usr','The Lion King Trailer... but a better, colorful version (Side-by-Side Comparison)','','The Lion King',0,12,'2019-04-20 01:21:23'),('bfde0v','New \'Tolkien\' Poster','','Tolkien',3187,224,'2019-04-20 11:30:30'),('bfe67j','Watched Batman 1989 on the big screen for the first time.','Holy shit it was glorious. \r\nMy apartment complex has a mini-theater that I rented for the night.\r\n\r\nI randomly decided to see what it\'d be like to watch Batman 89 on the big screen.\r\n\r\nWow.\r\n\r\nIt looked phenomenal.

It\'s easily up there with Cold War & Shoplifters as far as 2018 goes. Last year was pretty stacked in the category but I\'d easily put it in over Never Look Away & Capernaum.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to look it up and was pretty surprised that not a single South Korean film has ever been nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. This blew my mind.\r\n\r\nSome of the best modern directors are from South Korea. Chan-wook Park (Oldboy, The Handmaiden, Lady Vengeance), Joon-ho Bong (Okja, Snowpiercer, Memories of Murder, The Host), Chang-dong Lee (Burning, Secret Sunshine, Poetry), Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil, A Bittersweet Life, The Good the Bad the Weird). How has not a single one of these films even been *nominated* for the Oscar?\r\n\r\nJust by sheer market size you\'d think it would get appropriately represented at the Oscars. South Korea is the sixth-biggest market for films worldwide, by box office revenue (behind the US, China, India, Japan, and the UK). It\'s also in the top-10 in movie production.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea has submitted 30 films to the Oscars, and not one of them was nominated. Only Portugal, Romania, Egypt, and the Philippines have more submitted films without a nomination. 28 other different countries have been nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s up with the under representation of South Korea at the Oscars?','Yesterday',594,236,'2019-04-21 02:28:39'),('bfpst1','Lesser known films about young, very successful lawyers (or similar professions)','I love films like Devil\'s Advocate or The Firm where we get to watch these extremely promising, young lawyers who get a job at a big firm.

Less than a week until the conclusion of Space Rocks: The Rock Opera. I know many of you are mad excited. Because of this and the need for many to talk spoilers on our sub, we are bringing back something we haven\'t done since The Force Awakens. We only dust off the live thread, which goes up when the first worldwide airings drop, for the biggest most hyped releases. The live thread will be posted four hours after the first public showings in the world will air, in the Phillipines at around 6am their time. This thread will then conceivably pick up the first showings across the world then culminating in the release of the big official discussion when the last initial showings finish. This official discussion will be the main hub for all discussions of Endgame. The live thread will be linked to but not prioritized. **Remember we will remove all other discussions of Endgame when the official discussions is new**. So be sure to put all your crazy theories and thoughts in there. Remember there\'s also /r/marvelstudios, but they also are keeping all their discussions in one or two threads.\r\n\r\nSo the Endgame live thread will post April 23rd, 21:00 (-5:00 GMT). That timezone is also known as CDT. Then we will post the official discussion on April 25th, 22:00 (-5:00 GMT). As you may note that is an hour later than usual to account for the film\'s extended run time and the likely 8 billion trailers that will play before it.\r\n\r\nOne other thing to mention, for some reason reddit threads that hit over 100k comments start to get screwy and not allow new responses. Because of this we lock those threads and create new ones. We will almost certainly have to do that here, so if that happens the second official discussion will post May 2nd, 21:00 (-5:00 GMT) or May 9th, 21:00 (-5:00 GMT) depending on when those numbers hit 100k. Of course if it happens even sooner we\'ll do it sooner.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n[Whatever it takes,](https://i.imgur.com/l7daTuZ.png)\r\n\r\nThe Mods','Avengers: Endgame',1465,0,'2019-04-21 13:16:18'),('bfsaox','WW2 prison escape movie - Please help me find the one I\'m looking for.','Thank you for clicking my post.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI\'m looking for a movie I\'ve seen a very long time ago.

What about this movie is appealing to you guys?','I will just try to list what I think is wrong with the movie.\r\n\r\n* Two dream levels! Very smart of you Leonardo. 3 dream levels?! That is impossible! But we will try anyways. Wanna go down another level? Sure, whatev. Remember that time we told you 3 levels was damn near impossible? Fuck that shit, lets just add another one.\r\n* Hello, I am a random child prodigy. What do you want me to do? You must develop dream worlds, like the one we are in now. WTF? I am dreaming? *wakes up* You guys drugged and tranquillized me without my permission? Sure I will go on an illegal mission with you. I have no reason to distrust you... or even care about your cause. After all, I am but a simple child prodigy. Why not put my life in the hands of those that basically kidnapped me a little while back. (and don\'t tell me that she couldn\'t go back to dream worlds without them, because if pisspoor Africans can do it on a daily basis, a rich white kid wont have any problems)\r\n* All of a sudden, for no reason but to raise the stakes, death in the dreamworld is now permanent.\r\n* All of them are dream experts, yet none of them knew death in the dreamworld was permanent this time.\r\n* How the hell does the main character know that death in the dreamworld is permanent this time?\r\n* Remember that time you almost killed us by bringing us into a dreamworld in which we can die? Neither do we, lets be friends!\r\n* Why was going down a dreamlevel a valid cure for a guy who got shot in a previous dreamlevel?\r\n* I can hypnotize someone **TODAY** and plant an idea in their mind that isn\'t theirs. That person will believe this idea is entirely theirs.\r\n* The point of a totem is that you are the only one who knows its defining feature (be it weight or touch or whatever personal experience) Some other things which are also personal and that nobody else could decipher: The way your body feels or weighs. The sensation of clothes on your body. The amount of strength you require to make the sounds you make when you talk. Each of these is also personal and require input from yourself. The guests also participate in the dream by being there, breathing and walking. You fill those feelings in yourself. If someone were to decide what your hands feel like for you, or what your pants feel like for you, or how big your dick is, you would notice. These are all things you decide for yourself while you are in someone elses dreamworld. This renders totems useless since that is also something you could decide for yourself, just like you decide the way your hands feel.\r\n* The guy didn\'t look at his totem. This must be the open ending we have been waiting for! Wait, the totem is faltering, hence losing speed. Hence he isn\'t in a dreamworld.\r\n* But wait a minute, if he is stuck in a dreamworld, it would be either his own dreamworld, or his wifes dreamworld. Both of these people know the weight and feel of the totem, hence they would be able to emulate it perfectly.\r\n* The above argument applies to whenever you are stuck in your own dreamworld.\r\n* Regardless of how many levels down the happy couple was, in the real world they would no doubt require food.\r\n\r\nThis was just an attempt to try and seem smart but in the end it makes no sense because despite our limited knowledge about the subconscious, we still know a lot more than Nolan knows and his ignorance is showing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\nThe concept of dreamworlds makes no sense. Neither do totems. The majority of characters lack any depth or motivation. Also, WOW, 2 LEVELS?! OH NOES, 3 LEVELS?!!! OH NOES, 4 LEVELS?>?!?!!?!?!$?!!1 DING!

Why was this so highly rated? (Spoilers, obviously)','To be fair, I never liked the Planet of the Apes films. I always felt they were dull, poorly written products of the Red Scare. The Tim Burton reboot did little to convince me the story could work outside of the 60\'s - but I was dragged into this weekend\'s reboot regardless.\r\nLet me just point out the issues I have with this film\'s logic in chronological order.\r\n\r\n* How did a group of ape experts completely miss the fact that one of their subjects was not just pregnant, but gave birth overnight?\r\n* Why did the laboratory have so little protection? One ape gets loose, and it\'s only a hop, skip, and a jump away from the board of executives.\r\n* Lithgow\'s performance of an Alzheimer\'s patient was weak & generally poorly executed. Why did he only need doofy glasses when he was sick?\r\n* The fact that ALZ-112 just works overnight was just bad writing. It\'s a super-miracle drug beyond any realistic reach of science.\r\n* Franco\'s character seemed to have almost no protection to keep Ceasar from getting out of the house.\r\n* Why does the drug work for Lithgow for 5 full years before being rejected by the body? If anything, a 5+ year temporary cure still sounds like a marketable product. \r\n* Did Gen Sys honestly see nothing wrong with building a virus that can bypass the immune system? Even worse, when the lab assistant was exposed to it without a mask, he just walks out of the building. No quarantine, no hazmat team, they just let him leave. Even when he starts sneezing blood, nobody thinks twice about it.\r\n* When Ceasar bites the finger off of the pilot, why isn\'t he put down?\r\n* Why does San Fran have 100+ apes in Animal Control?\r\n* Why is such a massive ape compound only handled by three guys - two of which are unqualified slobs?\r\n* Does Franco\'s character never visit Ceasar? Because if he\'d seen the conditions of Ape-shwitz earlier, he would\'ve bribed the guard a lot sooner.\r\n* How does Caesar figure out ALZ-113 can improve ape intelligence?\r\n* Why does Malfoy turn on a tazer just before he\'s blasted with the hose?\r\n* How the hell can Ceasar talk?\r\n* Why is SFPD so understaffed?  One Helicopter and a few paddy wagons for a massive wild animal outbreak? No swat team? No national guard?\r\n* If the big ape fight occurs 8 years after the beginning of the film, why has nobody aged? Why are all the cars exactly the same? Why does one guy still use a Blackberry from 2008?\r\n* Why does the film end when the apes hide in the redwood forest?

In early 2010, a film that I consider my magnum opus, *The Orchestra of Invisible Instruments*, had its premiere. Nowadays, making a movie may seem like a simple task - it\'s easy to get hold of the right equipment and hire friends to act for you. Things become more difficult once you start working with famous artists and a crew of 30+ people.\r\n\r\n**A brief history**: I began working on my film in 2006. The script, heavily based on my personal experiences, was easy enough to create. I was attending film school (of sorts) back then, so when a famous actor Jan Machulski visited us, I decided to act and show him my work. He was kind enough to accept a major role in the movie. Once he was on board, people began gathering around me - call it domino effect. After a month, we had a sponsor, a very well-known composer and a couple of recognizable actors. That, and a technical crew of students and amateurs. We began filming. After about 10 days, two crucial members of the technical crew felt too much pressure and decided to leave us. Only through the determination of the rest of the crew did we finish shooting. Soon it became clear that the producer stole 3/4 of the budget and left us with giant debts. After years of finding a new sponsor, heavy post-production, reshoots etc. were we able to get this movie made. Unfortunately, Jan Machulski, the man who helped to start it all, didn\'t live to see it. \r\n\r\n**Achievements**: After the premiere, it was shown for two weeks in a cinema in Warsaw. I consider this to be my greatest success. It was also shown in the Museum of Cinematography in Lodz and was selected for the prestigious Festival of Polish Feature Films (*Festiwal Polskich Filmów Fabularnych*) in Gdynia.\r\n\r\n**Aftermath**: The festivals came and went and it seemed that The Orchestra of Invisible Instruments truly became invisible - it was impossible to see the movie anywhere due to its length. Then it struck me: Why not share the work that I\'d dedicated years of my lfe to with a broader audience? I\'ve decided to post it as a torrent so that people can share it. What surprised me the most was the number of people who were interested in watching it. At the moment of this writing, nearly 1000 people have downloaded it.\r\n\r\n**What\'s the movie about?**: *The Orchestra of Invisible Instruments* tells a story about crossing the line between love and obsession. It\'s a journey into the mind of a young and talented artist, who loses the trust of his partner.\r\n\r\nPiotr is an extraordinarily sensitive composer. He draws the inspiration for his music from his relationship with Basia, an energetic journalist. Jealousy is Piotr\'s greatest vice. The young artist wants his girlfriend to stay with him at all times, even though they both know that it\'s impossible. Just as Piotr decides to change in order to repair his failing relationship, an odd elderly man appears to tell him that he knows everything about his future.\r\n\r\n**Why am I writing this?**: This movie is my greatest achievement to date. It may not be on par with American blockbusters, it may not be the best made movie ever, but a great deal of work and a lot of love had been put into making it. If even one of you watches it and finds it entertaining on inspiring, I know that I\'ve made the right decision to write to you about it.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: I made a movie *The Orchestra of Invisible Instruments*: a drama about a young composer, who crosses the border between love and obsession. It was very hard to complete it. Some famous Polish artists are involved. I consider this to be my greatest artistic achievement.

The mood/style was very similar to any of Todd Solondz\' films (Storytelling, Happiness, et al). It took place in a upper middle class caricaturistic suburban housing development, kind of similar to the Black Hole Sun music video. I think the film opens with some kind of neighborhood barbecue. I thought that the main actor was the guy who played Shooter McGavin in Happy Gilmore, but I went through his imdb and came up short. It could still possibly have been him or a guy that looked like him.\r\n\r\nI don\'t really remember the action, except for there is an outsider involved. Perhaps a young man or boy who is hired to do lawn work or something. I think I remember him driving (in a van?) from a dark place outside of the housing development. Maaaaaaybe this character does something bad, but I\'m not sure. Perhaps he kills someone or has an affair with the main actor\'s wife. Super sketchy on the details.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I will seriously send a secret santa gift to the first person who finds this movie. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Solved. The movie is Lawn Dogs and does actually star Shooter McGavin.

He acknowledges similarities but denies the influence there.\r\n\r\nWhen we watched it, it was clear as day to me where the similarities lay and they were weirdly alike. Aronofsky even owns the American remake rights to it so he could use a particular scene in *Requiem For A Dream*. I think one of the little details that really got me was the character names; the lead for *Black Swan* just so happens to have a name which is two letters away from the *Perfect Blue* lead? (Nina and Mima respectively)\r\n\r\nSo why does he deny it?

','Unplanned',0,1,'2012-06-09 12:55:06'),('utsh1','Prometheus Analysis (MAJOR SPOILERS)- another allegory from R. Scott','I just got out of the movie and spent the ride home scribbling notes down on a McDonald’s bag I had in my car, so this writing will have all the weakness that come with extemporaneous expression and frantic explanation. \r\nIt’s my belief that Prometheus is almost entirely about the topic of abortion. \r\nI should explain that I am one of the people who views Alien as a complex allegory exploring the topic of rape, so it would make sense that I view this film as an extension of that exploration. In this way, let’s look at the film as being not only a part of the Alien universe, but also a continuation of the symbolic motifs present in the Alien universe.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation depends on the definition of abortion being the purposeful removal of a child/fetus at any stage before it is fully gestated and ready for birth. Taking this definition, let’s start with the beginning of the process.\r\n\r\nImpregnation:\r\nSymbolically, in this universe, rape is the primary means of reproduction. Speaking primarily and most directly of the alien species, the horror of these films comes from the fear of something unwanted being forced into your body. This concept is terrifying in its science-fiction wrapping, but the parallels to the horrors rape survivors endured are equally horrendous. \r\n	In the Alien films, this one being included, there are two methods by which someone becomes “pregnant.” The carriers of these unwanted life forms are either attacked directly and violently, or they are infected as a result of subterfuge and selfish plans.\r\n	We have seen both happen to the crews in the earlier Alien films, and Prometheus is no different. We see both the forceful impregnation of the geologist in the caves, and we see the planned impregnation of Charlie at the hands of David. \r\n	Viewing Prometheus first as an extension of the conversation about rape established in Alien, we can see here two symbolic references to ways a woman might become impregnated in a way that--and this leads to my later points—would make the pregnancy unplanned and the product unwanted.   		 Of course, most of the attacks can be viewed simply as rape, forceful, sudden, painful and unwarranted penetration or insertion. But Charlie’s case is more closely and specifically symbolic of date rape.\r\n	Here we have Charlie in a vulnerable position, both physically (inebriation) and emotionally (crushed dreams) hampered, and he is approached by someone he trusts. David then offers him a drink that is “spiked” with alien DNA, essentially making the drop of blood the symbolic equivalent of an intergalactic roofie.\r\n	It’s also worth mentioning that all of the pregnancies also come as a result of a lack of safety. Make of this what you will, but it stands that almost all of the victims meet their end due to a lack of safety or an unwillingness to wear appropriate protection.\r\n	Charlie is impregnated in this way, other crew members are forcefully impregnated, and Elisabeth is impregnated in a more conventional (although we know the offspring is anything but) way, but they all share the same opinion of their parasitic bodily guests: get it out of me.\r\nDeciding to abort:\r\nFirst, let’s focus on Elisabeth’s case, because we get the most violent depiction of abortion as a result of her understandable decision to remove the alien from her body. The second she is told she has a baby, she immediately goes through the range of emotions a woman might upon receiving similar news. She is full of disbelief at first. Then she wants to see the sonogram. Then she accepts the reality of the situation. At this point, she decides she does not want to “keep the baby.”\r\nThe interesting thing about the exchange that happens between David and Elisabeth here is that he makes specific reference to how far along she is: 3 months. It’s hard for me to believe that the writer would use a trimester as a measuring stick for her pregnancy if he didn’t intend on us making a connection to the rhetoric surrounding the abortion issue. Should we only allow first trimester abortions? Second? Is a third trimester abortion murder? All of these phrases immediately sprang to mind for me as soon as David said 3 months.\r\nCharlie spends a little while longer in the confusion and denial stages of his pregnancy journey than Elisabeth does with hers, but he reaches the same conclusion that she does: I do not want to be a carrier for this life form; I do not love it, nor did I ask for it.\r\n\r\nThese are the feelings of our human protagonists, but we can also see the motivations of the Engineers as a reflection of these same feelings. Having made the CONSCIOUS decision to make life on Earth, these “parents” decide they no longer want life for their children and decide to abort their science project on the planet we call home. The Engineers and David are thus actually the only characters in the equation who willingly engage in procreating, David through his trickery, and the Engineers through the sacrifice of the Engineer on the waterfall at the beginning of the film.\r\n\r\n','Unplanned',0,1,'2012-06-09 18:51:02'),('uyt1i','Something I never noticed about Back to the Future...','Im sure somebody has asked this before.\r\nOk, there is Biff in 1955 that bullies Martys dad.\r\nThere is Griff(Biff\'s Grandson) in 2015 that bullies Martys son.\r\nWhere is the missing link?

So I\'m posting this here in the hopes of generating interesting discussion. I\'m genuinely curious if anyone else had the same conclusions (especially regarding the Engineer changing his mind). Explaining these plot holes is therapeutic if anything. I didn\'t like this movie.*\r\n\r\n**In the prologue, how did the alien seed the planet with human DNA? Was this after the dinosaurs roamed the Earth? Was this seeding process the movie’s version of primordial ooze?**\r\nIt’s never explicitly mentioned that this is Earth. It could just be a nondescript planet. Later on in the movie, David encounters a holographic star map on the bridge of the Engineers’ ship. It’s safe to assume that they seeded numerous planets with intelligent life. Still, following the prologue, there’s a POV shot of Shaw and Holloway digging up one of the star maps. The transition subtly suggests they’re digging up what that particular Engineer did on Earth eons ago.\r\n\r\n**Why is the crew briefed right after cryostasis instead of on Earth?**\r\nThis was a trillion-dollar mission with super-secret motives. The crew was on a need-to-know basis and would not be briefed until they entered the moon’s solar system.\r\n\r\n**Why did the landing party take off their helmets once they detected an artificial oxygen atmosphere?**\r\nSure, they could have been exposed to a variety of airborne horrors, but I think the filmmakers went this route for practicality. Director Ridley Scott probably didn’t want his actors under a bunch of plastic helmets for most of the movie, so they needed a reason to have their helmets off once they’re investigating the pyramid. The in-movie reasoning is really dumb, but now the audience will have an easier time seeing their emotions as they continue to make horrible decisions. This is also when you can start viewing the movie as a big-budget SyFy original movie.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I think the movie tries to explain it as faith as there’s a clumsy faith-based undercurrent throughout the movie. Given the subject matter, it’s something that had to be addressed as it was in Ghostbusters, where Ray and Winston speculate whether the recent ghost outbreaks are biblical signs of the apocalypse. Though in that movie, the faith-based sentiment adds depth to those two characters while it’s mere window-dressing in Prometheus.\r\n\r\n**Where did the snake monster come from?**\r\nOnce the landing party enters the “face room”, there’s a quick shot of some weird, worm-like creatures. They probably quickly evolved once exposed to the black goop just as the thing in Shaw’s womb grew at an accelerated rate.\r\n\r\n**How did the black goop canisters open on their own?**\r\nAn air pressure change after 2000 years affected the containers? Or perhaps they were triggered to go off should anyone enter that room.\r\n\r\n**What were the holograms of Engineers running away from?**\r\nThey were running from a biological weapon they couldn’t control.\r\n\r\n**Why did David infect Holloway?**\r\nDavid has a super-secret virtual reality conversation with Weyland who tells him to “try harder”. Weyland is dying and he somehow thinks the Engineers have the key to life everlasting. Following his boss’ orders, he infects Holloway, the drunk, useless, anti-robot archaeologist to see what happens. David then learns that this will not cure his boss as Holloway turns into a scary zombie monster!\r\n\r\nThis is a bizarre logic leap not only for David, but the audience as well. He would probably want to examine the specimen for a bit longer than staring at a speck of it on his finger. And even if Holloway feels great after initial exposure, David should probably monitor the guy for a while. I mean, Seth Brundle was feeling pretty great after his little experiment on himself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps David understands that the goop is a spore-like bio-organism that mutates its host. It might not necessarily be a weapon, but it sure can be used as one! At least it gave him a reason to use a cool line from Lawrence of Arabia.\r\n\r\n**Why did Vickers have a medpod calibrated for men only?**\r\nThe medpod was for Weyland.\r\n\r\n**Why did the Engineer decide to kill everyone on Earth?**\r\nMy guess is after the Engineer wakes up only to hear everyone shout at him in a language he doesn’t understand, David is the only one who can speak the guy’s language. When the Engineer realizes that his progeny created an android in their own image and is the only one capable of communicating, he gets angry. So he knocks David’s head off. No one else bothered speaking the guy’s language; they just figured the robot could do it instead. So he gives Weyland a shiner and sets a course for Earth.\r\n\r\nAn alternate explanation is that the Engineer was already in stasis ready to travel to Earth when everything went horribly wrong 2000 years ago. He surmises from David that they’re from Earth and that the mission was never completed. He then sets a course for Earth to complete a mission that started 2000 years ago.\r\n\r\n**Okay, but why were all these canisters sitting out? When they were all wiped out by their weapons 2000 years ago, were they planning to wipe out humanity on Earth?**\r\nHere’s where things get really weird. It might actually be remnants of an earlier draft. What happened around 2000 years before the events of Prometheus, which occur in 2094? That’s right, the crucifixion of Christ! Ridley Scott explains why this might have bothered the Engineers:\r\n\r\n“It’s interesting to do a sequel because this leaves the door so open to some huge questions. The real question to me is – the more mankind discovers in science the more clear and helpful everything becomes, yet we’re very bad at managing ourselves. And one of the biggest problems in the world is what we call religion, it causes more problems than anything in the goddamn universe. Think about what’s happening now, all based on the very simple idea that a Muslim can’t live alongside a Catholic, or a Catholic can’t live alongside a Protestant…”\r\n\r\nIt would have been a bold move to put such a scathing anti-religion stance in a big summer movie, so I’m surprised this isn’t explicitly mentioned in the movie. They even took it a step further by suggesting that not only is Jesus your homeboy, but he’s also your resident extraterrestrial messiah:\r\n\r\n“We definitely did [have that in the script], and then we thought it was a little too on the nose. But if you look at it as an ‘our children are misbehaving down there’ scenario, there are moments where it looks like we’ve gone out of control, running around with armor and skirts, which of course would be the Roman Empire. And they were given a long run. A thousand years before their disintegration actually started to happen. And you can say, ‘Lets’ send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it. Guess what? They crucified him.’”\r\n\r\nFor all the nonsense in Prometheus, I kind of love that insane idea. It wouldn’t be the first time it was suggested that J.C. was an alien; the John Carpenter classic Prince of Darkness presents Jesus as an extraterrestrial.\r\n\r\n**Why wasn’t the Engineer left to die in his chair as he was found at the beginning of Alien?**\r\nIt’s the same species, same ship type, same bridge, but a different planet altogether. Aside from all the nonsense fanservice, the movie never suggests that it’s the same planet the Nostromo visits in Alien. That rock was particularly far from its sun (you can see it far off in the distance in a few exterior shots) and the Engineer was fossilized. Besides, Prometheus refers to its moon as LV-223 while Lambert charts a course for LV-427 in Alien.\r\n\r\n**So in the epilogue, did the Engineer give birth to a proto-xenomorph?**\r\nNo, it isn’t the first one. When the landing party first enters the “face room” Holloway spends a good bit of time looking at a xenomorph mural. The Engineers presumably created the xenomorphs as a biological weapon. Things obviously got a little out of hand.\r\n\r\n**Why does that xenomorph look so weird though?**\r\nThis one’s tough. Not that it’s complex, but at this point I feel like I’m wrestling with really stupid logic. I dunno, maybe Shaw’s alien-baby needed a couple more trimesters before cigars are in order. Maybe she would have given birth to a big ol’ facehugger which in turn would have created a proper xenomorph. I don’t know. This movie is stupid.\r\n\r\n**If humans have the same DNA as Engineers, why aren’t humans 9 ft. tall albinos?**\r\nSee, I was fine with our progenitors being these hulking Powder cosplayers. Maybe there were a few extra ingredients on Earth that created the wonderful spectrum of humanity that populates the planet today. Then the movie goes out of its way to explain that humans have an exact DNA match with the engineers. I’m no scientist (if you haven’t guessed already), but I’m pretty sure we would all have to be hulking honkies to have an exact DNA match.\r\n\r\n**Why did the Engineers paint those star maps all over the world if it only led to a moon with a horrible biological weapons facility?**\r\nIt definitely isn’t their home; they had to create an artificial oxygen atmosphere.

','[Amazing Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA6FFnjvvmg)\r\n\r\nSo I went to see Beasts of the Southern Wild tonight.  After seeing the previews, I went expecting a slightly magical experience, one that mirrors “active imagination” films, such as Big Fish and Finding Neverland.  Instead, I was treated to something altogether unexpected.  \r\n\r\nI wanted, so badly, to love the film.  I really did.  I started out trying so hard to love the slightly-shaky camera work, the deliciously trashy sets, the way the characters were so electrifyingly written.  But I found myself panning out flat; not feeling joy, or smiles, or even hatred, but a disturbingly, marginally disgusted emotion that I can\'t quite nail down.  I felt deflated and grumpy, but that made me try even harder to enjoy what has been the best reviewed drama of the season.  \r\n\r\nAs I watched more, I started to spiral into the winter of my discontent.  Really?  THIS is happening?  Damn.  I can\'t believe I worked myself up over this.  But, about midway through the movie, I noticed that my mouth was dry.  I took a sip of my watered down Long Island to compensate.  Then I noticed that my hands were clenched.  I loosened them, only to find them tight again two minutes later.  \r\n\r\nI somehow found myself on the edge of my seat, gazing at the screen, the other people in the theater entirely forgotten.  What had happened?  The film had seamlessly drawn me from mild disgust to total empathy without a moment\'s notice.  Every time I thought I had the storyline read, it switched up; not in a M. Night-ian, sensationalist manner, but with an artfully crafted subtlety that made me wonder how it had happened.  I was trying hard not to fidget, not to grind my teeth, not to dig my fingernails into my palm.  I was completely absorbed into the characters in a way that has not happened to me in a long time.  \r\n\r\nAs the film came to a close, I sat in the theater trying to remember how to breath regularly.  My Oh-So-Happy world of Indy film had been turned up-side down.  As I sat during the credits trying to mentally label the movie, I couldn\'t.  It resisted fitting a single mold, withstood any proscribed path, refused to form to any stereotype.  That\'s when it finally dawned on me that Beasts of the Southern Wild happily defied my every expectation in their basest forms: it is, truly and completely, an original film.  And I cannot give it higher praise than that.  \r\n\r\n“In a million years, when kids go to school, they are gonna know, that there was once a Hushpuppie, and lived with her Daddy in a Bathtub.”','Midway',20,7,'2012-06-28 00:52:13'),('vt4jp','Which fantasy/sci-fi book or series would you most like to see made into films?','Every reader must have a list of books or series that they would love to see made into films.

However, it was interesting enoough that I figured I could have fun over-reading it.  Don\'t take this too seriously, but I thought Reddit might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nMagic Mike(An analysis): \r\nDesexualized sex and the return of conservative notions of sex\r\n	First and foremost, it should be noted that throughout history, there has been a deep connection between film and sex.  It was the traveling porno films that were prevalent during the turn of the 19th century that popularized the idea of film and proved the demand for such a commodity as film.  On a cursory glance, Magic Mike, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a return to one of the origins and prime movers of the film industry: unabashed and blatant sexual content.  However, even on the surface of the film, it is not such a simple retreat.  While the film does have its prism-less sexual content (mostly resigned to the dance routines), the film tries to also maintain a meaningful plot, as if that is what will bring the audience.  And thus, we end up with a divided, polar film, split between base sexual content of the male stripper’s performances and the story of stripper’s personal experiences.  Because of this split, the deeper meaning of the film appears split along the lines of social liberalism and social conservatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us start at the beginning: the film opens on the main character, Mike (Channing Tatum), waking up after a sexual liaison with his long time hookup, Joanna (Olivia Munn), and some anonymous young woman.  This scene masterfully accomplishes several tasks.  First, it sets the stage and well defines Mike as a person who has become completely sexualized (it seems here that the director knows the audience already knows who Mike is, specifically a stripper).  It also outlines the predicament Mike is in in a wonderfully stilted way.  Joanna ask about his odd furniture and Mike explains it is his dream to build this strange furniture once he can escape the stripper lifestyle.  Finally, the truly interesting aspect of this scene is the anonymous woman.  She remains unconscious the whole time, meanwhile the position of the actors and the dialogue between Joanna and Mike imply and portray her as simply a sexual object to be used by them (“My god, they did not even know her name!  How hilarious and also very depressing!”).  Could Soderbergh, perhaps, be using this to directly criticize his audience, many of whom came to his movie for simple sexual stimulation?  Is not the anonymous woman (who face we do not see) representing the audience; and thus having the table turned, they themselves become simply “used” by the film’s characters for sexual enjoyment (or literally being drained of money through the admission ticket)?  This belies an almost pathological hatred of sex in the film.  For such a “raunchy” film, no actual sex is even partially seen.  The closest we, the audience, come to seeing anything is a scene where “The Kid” (Alex Pettyfer) copulates with the party girl Nora (Riley Keough).  And it is this act of copulation that is decried and advised against, even by the experienced, fully-sexualized Mike.  Similar to the hurricane which backgrounds the scene they meet in, this woman “wrecks” the Kid, effectively destroying the Kid’s status quo and sending him into a drug overdose.  Is this not very, very conservative, going all the way back to the ancient Israelites?  Those who point to the fall of man as being caused by a woman?  Thankfully, the film is not so close-minded, since the character of Brooke (Cody Horn), the Kid’s sister, opposes her as the harmonious, desexualizing influence on both Mike and her brother.  In essence, the film is saying that woman can either be a destructive influence when they are a sexual force or they can be a positive one when they are a conservative, desexualizing kind (However, if a woman is desexualized, can she truly be called a woman?  But is it not the woman’s sexual nature, relative to men, that makes her a woman rather than a ‘thing’ and vice-versa for men?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the film, inversely, begins on a “morning after” (before Mike has gone through his “spiritual growth” from stripper to non-stripper) and ends on the presumed hook-up of Mike and the Kid’s sister Brooke (Cody Horn).  It is not so simple that Mike has moved from emotionally “unattached” sex to the “attached” variety, since the final scene without Joanna makes it painfully clear that Mike did “attach” himself to her, albeit in a more 21st century, friends-with-benefits-but-still-more-than-friends way.  So while Mike may have “progressed” in the film from stripper to non-stripper in the literal sense, in terms of social history, Mike has “regressed” from the “free love” of the 1960’s and 70’s to a more puritan form of love and engagement.  While the surface of Magic Mike leads us to be a hedonistic society, without barriers for sexual engagement and openly enjoying in sexual titillation, the film criticizes this and attempts to return its audience to a clichéd, 1950’s form of love, where the man is not a stripper, only wants to work hard, and the woman is suitably maternal (is not the scene of Brooke driving the overdosed Kid framed and shot exactly as sleeping child waking up to seeing his mother driving him somewhere?).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the Kid, his “development” is interesting in that it is comprised of the blackest of comedy and satire.  He begins the film as a quiet, lost soul who can’t hold a job and relies on his (maternal) sister.  Had he remained as such, he would be a great representation of the current “lost generation” who in the Great Recession are without means to provide for themselves and must return to their parental dwellings (see “Boomerang Generation”).  Do not forget that while Brooke fills in for the Kid’s maternal role, he is without a legitimate father figure (Mike is unsuitable replacement for a father figure, as displayed by the maternal disapproval supplied by Brooke.  And is it not the stereotype that people become strippers because of father issues?)  However, Mike acts a corrupting, “sexualizing” on the youth.  Through this corruption, the Kid actually loses his character depth, culminating in his first “performance” on stage.  Is not the performance, in which he meekly takes off his clothes, strikingly similar to how one may take their clothes off to go swimming?  And with his “plunge” off the stage, can he not be said to entering the water and transitioning from “character” into “caricature”?  “Caricature” in that he becomes what conservatives would call the figure comprising  the moral depravity and terrible lifestyle of the stripper; who partakes in drugs, engages in promiscuous sex (could not Nora’s teacup pig represent bestiality so often used to decry “subversive” sexual behavior such as homosexuality?), and promotes violent behavior (ex. The fight during the “police officer” scene).  It is painfully clear that, if you hold the notion of Mike and the rest of the male strippers as negative influences on the youth, the “training” scene takes on new meaning.  When Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) teaches the Kid to symbolically f#%k the women in his dance routine, he does so in front of a mirror.  Is this not a succinct depiction of the director’s disdain for sex?  Here is the Kid, the youth of the film, essentially f#$king his previous self, “degrading” himself to the level of a stripper.  The truly sublime about the character of the Kid is his final scene, in which he thanks Mike for “improving” his life: “(paraphrased) My life is great.  I can get any girl I want, I have money, I am having fun”.  What makes this so sublime is what he does not say: “I am indebted to you for $10,000, I am wrapped up in drugs and crime, I have a socially unacceptable job, and the girls I get involved with cause me to go into drug overdoses.  It’s all thanks to you, Mike”.  The true question for this character is whether he is a sarcastic depiction, merely giving in to the popular conservative notions of male strippers while subtly nudging at its preposterousness, or if the director truly views these individuals as such.  That is a question better left to be answered by the director himself or an uncut version of the film, which could offer more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n (This is the summary for those that skipped the rambling)  So where does all this leave us?  In the end, we are left with a somewhat frightening film, at least in what it implies in a social context.  The development of Mike is, in a sense, regressive.  In the end, he is desexualized by the maternal influence of Brooke and conforms to the standard notions of sex and love.  The Kid remains a train wreck, with no signs of having developed much self-awareness after the triple disaster of the fight, the involvement with drug rings, and the overdose.  Even Brooke is rehabilitated in the eyes of the film.  Now that Mike has been “fixed”, she may become the sexual object women are often designated to be in films, as she does when the film ends on their hookup (it is very telling to note that even in a film directly marketed to women, Magic Mike fails the feminism test of having two women talk to each other about something other than men).  In the end, Magic Mike, despite it seeming liberal bias towards sexual promiscuity, turns out to be a conservative backlash against the stripper lifestyle, complete with all stereotypes attached to it.\r\n\r\nMagic Mike:\r\nCome for the sexual content, stay for the social conservatism and denunciation of strippers\r\n','The Kid Who Would Be King',2,4,'2012-07-07 14:17:32'),('w6qv8','Charlie\'s Angels: Yet Again...

Not a great movie or western, for me','Just rewatched parts of True Grit, and had the same reaction as in the theater: *meh*. I love the Coen Brothers (Miller\'s Crossing is a favorite), Jeff Bridges, and westerns in general but this movie never came together for me. For starters, I didn\'t like the performance of the girl who played Mattie. It was very one-dimensional to me -- the writing and the acting. I know the Coens love their hyper-intelligent dialogue, but there are other way to show a character has intelligence and courage. It\'s called acting, and I didn\'t find it convincing. Her language never changed, although her circumstances certainly did. She seemed to have a rigid moral code, yet had no problem with Cogburn ambushing and shooting people in the back. The ability to hold and express two different beliefs/thoughts is what makes characters/art unique, and her character/performance didn\'t cut it for me. I also get that she was supposed to be an unusual, formidable character, but it seems to me that a 14-y-o girl in that time/place would have been treated as a woman (as opposed to a child) and likely a prostitute. Maybe I\'m basing this on watching movies instead of actual history, but I don\'t think many women, let alone girls, went around by themselves or in the company of only men in that scenario.\r\n\r\nI also never fully got into Bridges\' character, either -- the way it was written or the way he played it. Why did he stop LaBoeuf from spanking Hallee? Crossing a river on a horse was enough to convince this hardened man that she was worth his regard? It was impressive horsemanship, I guess, but certainly not a crucible. (And why isn\'t she drenched when she gets to the other side of the river?) Why did he start blabbing his life story to Hallee? He didn\'t seem like the confessor type. Bridges was sufficiently crusty and ornery, at least at the beginning, but never felt he truly expressed the strong connection with Hallee enough to justify his actions later. \r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, Ned Pepper\'s teeth were much scary than his character. If we\'re spending a good deal of the time chasing this outlaw, shouldn\'t he be a lot more fearsome? He did step on Hallee\'s face, which was one of the few times she truly faced violence, but after that he was just some guy.\r\n\r\nBeautiful compositions, (although a little too much snow for me), quirky characters (loved Damon in this -- ridiculous and super serious all at once), and some wacky dialogue, as always in the Coen movies. But as a movie, and especially a western, I just didn\'t buy it. Is it as simple as the fact that it was told from the viewpoint of a young girl, which I\'m not able to relate to? (My wife won\'t watch westerns, yet liked the movie very much.)\r\n\r\nWould love to hear other opinions...','Super Intelligence',0,1,'2012-07-08 08:54:17'),('Which',' while in context it\'s probably awesome',' ripping off some dude\'s head and dropping it at the enemy\'s feet is perhaps a little too intense a way to establish her character for a trailer audience.

Using promotional materials I was able to reconstruct the end and around 150,000 views have been accumalted on youtube, including around 900 hundred comments. I\'d love to show WB, the now rights holders of the film, the interest in a full version of the film. Show them the stats of people watching the sequence etc. I have no idea how/who to approach though? \r\n\r\nDoes Reddit have an idea?\r\nIt\'s my current life dream to see a workprint of the movie and the film in question is *The Golden Compass*. Before you jump on me, read the full reasons etc... here:           \r\n\r\n**[long version]**    \r\nPersonally, I grew up with the book Northern Lights, and as released the sequels that followed. I fell in love with the books and they\'ve been an inspiration and reread again and again. The mix of fantasy, scifi and real world issues was an intoxicating mix.    \r\n       \r\nWhile at university it was announced that New Line cinema were going to take on the triliogy of books now that they had completed The Lord of The Rings movies.     \r\n\r\nFilmed under the american name, The Golden Compass, was at first hit with directing problems. In the end the studio decided to use Chris Weitz, quite inexperienced with handling a studio at this point. The movie was filmed and trailers started to appear. Could they actually pull it off?    \r\n\r\nJust 3 months prior to release Chris Weitz told fans, in a polite manor, that his film had just been gutted. He hope that he would be able to make a directors cut in the future. New Line had got scared - this is a film that deals with the death of children, strong religious elements, and a story that handles multi-universes. The film is dated for december, they want a child friendly film that has talking polar bears.        \r\n\r\n*Immediatly the ending of the film is removed. It\'s not exactly a clean happy ending, so they add new incomplete ending. They now need a climax to the film, so events in the film are completely restructured. They want a guranted pull, so they add in big name actors, adding in Sir Ian Mckellin (replacing another actor) and a random cameo from Christopher Lee. They want it shorter, so 40 minutes of subplots are removed (including the scrapping of the authors favourite filmed scene). They remove the original intro and put a standard voice over intro over cut clips to make it easier for people to understand this fantasy world. Then bowing to pressure from the Catholic church they go in and digitally modify signs that have any religious text or symbol. Finally they make sure that any extra violence is removed to make it extra friendly for children.*\r\n\r\nIn the end the film that reached cinemas is not what was really filmed. As a fan I was devestated. The characters were there and they were doing scenes that came across as a great adaption. The result is that the film just doesn\'t feel complete and storylines are left so open that the film is a confusing mess.      \r\n\r\nTo keep myself entertained over the last few years I\'ve researched the deleted sequences and in some cases I\'ve managed to reconstruct some of the missing sequences. My main achievement is having a watchable copy of the deleted ending:             \r\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWM3XrnlNTU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWM3XrnlNTU) (obviously spoilers for the film and a bit rough at points, this is the latest version).    \r\n\r\nThe sequences I have made have been reconstructed from every bit of footage from trailers, online clips, storybooks, stickers, videos from the computer game and any other promo material I could find.     \r\n\r\nChris Weitz looked at how much it would cost to complete the film to his vision, it would be $15 mil. The chances of any new version of the film coming out looks increasingly unlikely. Obviously there will never be any sequels.\r\n\r\nNew Line went into administration as the movie failed to achieve and domestic impression, and while it achieved over £300 million world wide, the studio had sold the international distribution rights so no money was gained from that market. Warner Brothers purchased the rights to New Line and the film. \r\n\r\nI\'d love to show them the love that\'s still there for the film, even in the state released. Heck even having the deleted scenes on as an extra on a release would be huge for the fans... Personally as mentioned earlier, it would be a true dream come true to see the movie in workprint format - maybe a dual release like the blade runner release with the theatrical cut and the workprint?\r\n\r\nI don\'t know - but my request is does anyone know an email that I can send to, explaining the 150,000 people who\'ve watched the video, the demographics involved, whats been watched, the comments made. Maybe it could lead to something, it\'s a long shot and the chances of it making any impact are slim to none. \r\n\r\nIn the end, you have to try, and reddit is my long shot in making that attempt.

Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a “spy” named George Kaplan and is promptly kidnapped.\r\n\r\nIf you stopped your VCR (remember, you’re at your grandmother’s house while watching this) right then and there you’d probably look at me and say “What’s wrong with that asshole?”\r\n\r\nListen, I don’t know how the spy game worked in 1859, or 1959, or whatever ancient decade this piece of crap was written in, but I’m pretty sure that there is a more effective way to dispose of a troublesome government agent then to force him to drink liquor and put him behind the wheel of his car on a windy cliff road.\r\n\r\nHell, back in the 50’s that’s how everyone drove home anyway.\r\n\r\nYou might as well try to kill a Rastafarian with dirty bong water.\r\n\r\nWhat’s wrong with just shooting a guy and dumping his corpse in the river? That’s how half of American marriages end anyway.\r\n\r\nTo no one’s surprise, this ingenious plot device doesn’t work, and now we get to see some classic 1950’s style acting in which everyone who is drunk starts singing and babbling like they just came out of a meeting of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes.\r\n\r\nRoger’s suit is as natty as ever, and his hair is perfect.\r\n\r\nI was a doorman at a bar for 10 years.\r\n\r\nHere’s what it SHOULD have looked like:\r\n\r\nLarge stain of piss in the crotchetorial regions (soiled back optional), crust of vomit in the corner of mouth, and hair that looks like a bird’s nest (if the bird in question likes to build a home with cigarette butts, French fries and those tiny plastic swords that hold maraschino cherries).\r\n\r\nBasically, we’re talking about Amy Winehouse.\r\n\r\nEven more disturbing though is the fact that Cary (who looks like he’s in his fifties) calls his mother to come and get him out of jail.\r\n\r\nDude, you don’t have any friends? You sure as hell don’t have any shame.\r\n\r\nEvery man on the planet has a secret bank account that one of his friends has access to. In this account goes poker winnings which are stored to get you out of jail, or out of a beating when you’ve spent three hours in the champagne room and discover that you only have 100 bucks in your wallet.\r\n\r\nYou call your buddy, get your ass bailed out, and when your mom asks you where you were the night before, you tell her it was with a cheap woman and some expensive wine.\r\n\r\nIs this something that we invented in the 80’s?\r\n\r\nSheesh.\r\n\r\nWell, it gets more ridiculous from here because in the next scene, Roger tracks down the man whose house he was kept in at the United Nations.\r\n\r\nSensing that Jaggermeister Bombs are less effective that actual bombs, the spies decide to throw a knife at Roger, but instead end up killing a diplomat.\r\n\r\nTalk about going from one extreme to another!\r\n\r\n“Make it look like an accident”, suddenly turns into tossing kitchen knives in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nWho the hell is running the planning department with these guys?\r\n\r\nWhat’s the next step, carpet bomb the city and blame Hitler?\r\n\r\nNaturally Roger immediately grabs hold of the knife protruding from the diplomat’s back, and in a shrewd bit of foreshadowing, he also leaves behind a semen sample so that DNA can implicate him in the killing thirty years later.\r\n\r\nWhen people turn and look all that anyone sees is Roger holding the knife.\r\n\r\nYa, I was going to write something sarcastic, but really… what’s the point?\r\n\r\nRoger is on the run and he jumps on a train whereupon he meets the biggest whore on the planet named Eve Kendall, who immediately hides him in her room and then helps him elude the police.\r\n\r\nTrain sluts.\r\n\r\nIf you think they’re a rare bird then go watch “The Manchurian Candidate.”\r\n\r\nAmtrak is a rolling brothel.\r\n\r\nAhhh, but you say… Eve is really a double agent and is working for the spies.\r\n\r\nAgain I would like to point out that the planning department at the spy agency is going through some kind of internal power struggle, because now we’re back to trying to kill Roger with venereal diseases, or death by hickey.\r\n\r\nWhere’s Stabby Mcgee? The man is on a train for fuck’s sake. It’s a long metal tube about fifteen feet wide. Even if you throw the knife and miss him, it will probably bounce off the wall and get him on the rebound.\r\n\r\nA shotgun would be pretty effective here.\r\n\r\nLet’s eavesdrop on the planning department shall we?\r\n\r\n“Ya, so I know that the gin and tonic didn’t work, and the knife thing sucked, and the whore is useless, but now I have an ingenious idea.”\r\n\r\n“Well good, because quite honestly we were thinking of letting you go. What’s the new idea?”\r\n\r\n“Death by crop duster.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Johnson? Can you get Monster.com on the phone?”\r\n\r\n“No wait… hear me out… We lure him out to the middle of nowhere see, and he stands at the crossroads. Then when he’s alone, we fly a plane down really low and try to cut him in half. We may or may not have a machine gun on the plane, that may or may not shoot at him on every third pass, and if he hides in the reeds we’ll spray him with chemicals!! He’ll die of cancer in twenty years.”\r\n\r\n“Everyone smokes like a chimney in 1958. We’ll ALL be dead of cancer in twenty years.”\r\n\r\n“Oh… um…”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll give this idea one more chance, but make sure you hire a good pilot. I don’t want some idiot who just learned how to fly and ends up hitting a gasoline tanker truck in the middle of the prairies.”\r\n\r\nThis people, is the most talked about scene in the film. You’ve all seen it, and now you too can marvel at the stupidity of it all.\r\n\r\nHow are you going to make this look like an accident? You’ll either cut him in half (very inconspicuous) or you’ll shoot him from a passing plane.\r\n\r\nThis is the one bone fide moment when they can pull up in a tank and roast him with a flame thrower and there are no witnesses!!\r\n\r\nOh, I can just anticipate the hateful emails flooding in as I type this.\r\n\r\nOf course, they’re all going to be signed “Tilley”, or “Edna” or will be written by a cat but in the end you know I’m right.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the cavalcade of stupidity rolls on and now we discover that Eve is really a double spy working for the government and is in fact not trying to kill Roger even though the bitch totally set him up for the crop duster hit.\r\n\r\nRoger, after getting boned on the train forgives all, and when he learns that Eve is in danger from the real spies runs up Mount Rushmore (apparently they have luxury condos on Washington’s forehead) and rescues her.\r\n\r\nFade to black.\r\n\r\nI repeat… OLD MOVIES SUCK!!','Knives Out',0,9,'2012-07-31 10:37:58'),('xm079','Need your help r/movies!','I\'m trying to find a movie.\r\n\r\nWhat I can remember is that there is a group of people in this house that has a bunch of rooms.

Where can I buy the most accurate replica without breaking the bank?\r\n\r\n I\'ve looked in a few places, but the jackets are either $300+ or not that similar. The most glaring problem with most of the cheaper jackets is that the length of the coat is usually to the waist, while in the movie the coat is closer to the knees in length.','Replicas',1,4,'2012-08-03 18:28:47'),('xrq71','I love legos and I love Serenity.

He comes back when hes a man and remebers/reflects all of this.  For some reason I have always remebered this scene/movie but have never known the title.  Any guesses would be great.
